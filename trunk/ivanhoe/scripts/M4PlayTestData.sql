Andryot père, aged fifty-four, thin, nervous, bilious, and speculative ; Mme. Andryot mère, forty-two, fat, red, and fierce ; the son René ; the daughter Sylvie ; the wife of René, Héloise Ducorneau her maiden name, presumably the heroine of this criminal case. M. Poulain, Mme. Andryot\'s father, died July 1836. His fortune, got by grocery, fell to his married daughter ; the only legacy was one of 3000 francs to his granddaughter-in-law. It is noticeable that Mlle. Ducorneau\'s early reputation was of the most equivocal. She had a coarse beauty and a broad fashion of insolent flattery to help her forward ; she married at twenty-five René Andryot, aged twenty. The two Mmes. Andryot were open enemies from the first. In a year\'s time René was heard to express weariness and fear of his wife ; M. Andryot senior was always on her side; he was nobody, had not a voice in the family, was less considered than a servant, etc. This young man had the shrill, querulous weakness of a sickly and ill-natured fool ; he had married Héloise and her ill fame in a feeble spasm of self-assertion, and was disposed to take out the value of his sacrifice in small daily change. Mlle. Ducorneau had no such change at hand. She insulted him broadly and publicly for his weakness of character, taunted him with her own bad repute, spent his money, and battled with the mother and sister Andryot day and night. Jean Pierre Andryot, ex-silk-mercer, was her one friend and ally. These were the family relations of this household in 1836.     Sylvie Céleste Madeleine Andryot, the daughter, inherited from her mother the temper, morals, manners, face and figure of the religious bourgeoise in high development. Her com-plexion was iron-grey, her eyes olive green, her outlines bony, her skin dry and stiff.  She was so dreadful that she might have won the prix Montyon for hideous virtue, if such a prize had been established for the two qualities together. It follows naturally that she hated her sister-in-law with all her might of hate. It also follows that M. Robinet, her directeur, partook of this feeling, and as this priest had afterwards some influence on the fortunes of this family, the point is worth noting. Héloise was, by the way, what may be called a professional atheist. She asserted her opinion so violently and with such little provocation that the most patient of the devout might have been forgiven some slight aversion.    A fortnight after M. Poulain\'s decease the fight began over his remains. Héloise dragged the body of this ancient Patroclus by the head, Sylvie and her mother by the feet. At last mother and daughter contrived to quash the legacy. The old man was doting -- had been taken with a sickly fondness for his grandson\'s wife -- she had swindled him out of this legacy. Their relations had been a perfect scandal, disgusting -- \"this woman, figure to yourself, my dear Madame Flicoteau\" (Madame Andryot confided the cause of sorrow to the family attorney\'s wife, a devout woman and her friend),\" she would sit with the poor old broken man reading, oh, the most infamous books!\" (violent verbal italics). \"He was an incredule of the ancient type, this poor father, and she would read to him out of his old books -- mais tout ce qu\'il y a de plus encyclopedigue, de plus Diderot, et puis des saletés á faire rugir les hussards!\"   Such were the worthy woman\'s assertions, screeched out in a note \"like the last rattle in the throat of a dying cockatoo,\" said Héloise. At last she went so far, in her triumph after the decision against her enemy, that Héloise and her father, M. Ducorneau, got. an action of slander against her, and she had to pay a fine, plus her costs. Worse remained : M. Andryot, indignant with his wife, settled the value of the original legacy on his daughter-in-law, payable out of his own resources. Fresh shrieks from the defeated wife and daughter ; fresh insults on both sides. Presently Réne fled, and M. Andryot took to drinking. Deserted by her husband, who set up on his own small account in Paris, the provident Héloise Andryot cast about for new friends. M. Paul-Honoré Baptiste Foulard, a doctor, was the object of her choice. She fell into a habit of weak health, and took remedies innumerable. Foulard\'s visits became daily, and were prolonged for hours. Again the clatter of provincial scandal began. But this time the lady met it like a heroine. Forsaken and unhappy, she had found in this young doctor a noble soul to understand her own, a brother\'s hand to support her feebleness. For the rest, Foulard was gifted with so singular and exquisite an ugliness that scandal was compelled to presume in Héloise a monstrous preference for the repulsive, before it could pronounce upon her guilt. Within the next year M. Andryot, the father, fell ill. The three women and Foulard watched him constantly ; but his progress for the worse was rapid, and he died in three weeks.      Madame veuve Andryot was now mistress of the field.. She asserted with open violence, what her daughter hinted with a sad hesitation, that her husband\'s end was hastened by the tender cares of his son\'s wife. The fury of Héloise at this charge threw upon her a very unwise course. She declared that if there was any murderer in the case, it was the dead man\'s wife. Night and day, when quiet was most requisite, and after Foulard had declared that perfect pest of mind and body could alone save the patent, Madame veuve Andryot had hovered about the sick room with spiritual consolations and warnings more harassing than any sickness. On the very evening of the decease, the priest Robinet had been closeted with her and the dying man for the space of half an hour. M. Andryot had refused the viaticum : why was this priest there at all ? Why was she, why was the doctor excluded ? All this Héloise articulated in a harsh excited tone, summoning the widow to answer.     The charge against the priest fell through at once. Madame Andryot, encouraged by her daughter, proceeded to lay a direct accusation against the bringer of it for the same offence. The trial was to come on shortly before the criminal courts.     Foulard on hearing of this displayed the most abject nervous terror. Displayed, we say advisedly, for his passion of alarm was so ostentatious and loud as to seem calculated beforehand with a view to general notice. This point also we invite the student of the case to observe. His supposed accomplice, eased perhaps by her own furious outbreak of spite, was calm, warm, sparing and moderate of speech. Many persons were conciliated by the patient sorrowful manners in her, new and noticeable. The two dévotes were shrill, clamorous, and reckless.     A week before the trial Madame veuve Andryot disappeared, and disappeared utterly and for ever. To this day no clue has been found to this singular riddle. All the other parties to these proceedings being dead, we cannot suppose one ever will be.     The case came on. Sylvie Andryot was the mainspring of the prosecution against Héloise. She swore positively to having seen arsenic in the medicine administered to her father by this latter, Jean Pierre Andryot had drunk three-quarters and put it away with the usual complaint of the taste. She had afterwards examined it and found what she now produced. This was analysed, and, to the astonishment of the whole court, found to be a perfectly innocent substance, a deposit which had been allowed to settle in the medicine.     It would now have gone hard with Mlle. Andryot but for two considerations. First ; a person not acting throughout in good faith, however biassed by personal antipathy, would have laid her plan too well to be upset by so absurdly simple an oversight. If she had substituted anything for the real draught, she must have taken care to substitute a real poison. Secondly; the other circumstances of the case were very strong against the accused. Foulard\'s extreme terror -- her own dubious character -- her ridiculous accusation of Madame Andryot -- everything told against her. Finally, the unaccountable disappearance of Madame Andryot was laid hold of as a suspicious point.  Whose interest was it that she should not be present to give evidence ?  Several witnesses spoke to the character of loise. Madame Flicoteau, the notary\'s wife, swore to the expressions cited above, as having been uttered by Madame A. in conversation with her shortly after old M. Poulain\'s decease. The affair of the legacy was brought up and so handled as to blacken still further the reputation of the accused. Réne Andryot was the next witness. He spoke with violence against his wife\'s character : his evidence was of little value in consequence, except insomuch as it gave fresh proof of the family relations. M. Robinet, the curé, bore witness to her bad repute, and to one scandalous detail he swore personally as an eye and ear witness. This detail we abstain from reproducing here. It has no direct bearing on the case.      All this time, the reader sees, not probably without wonder, not one tittle of proof was brought as to the actual criminality of Héloise. No ill will was proved against her father-in-law ; he was her one friend in the family. It was not proved that his death was hastened by any external means. Foulard\'s medical evidence was perfectly satisfactory. Nothing was gained by Andryot\'s death to any one but his hcirs. Neither Héloise nor Foulard were legatees : the will simply recommended her to her husband\'s care.

Art to most people means the Mona Lisa, not the graf on the wall by the subway station, or the little commic book shop run by their neighbor. It\'s been removed from life and placed in a glass box, to be studied in ivory towers, to be faux-respected on dates, but not to be enjoyed. Diter Roth made interactive pieces, playful works from chocolate and toy soldiers, large, rotating wheels that were specifically meant for the viewer to spin, and what does the MoMA do? \"Do not touch\" signs. Fuck! Who cares if the thing falls apart in 30 years? It\'s getting less relevant by the minute. Let people enjoy it while it\'s here. It\'d be better to get 30 years of good use out of it than never to allow people to fully experience it.\nMusic is certainly better. For whatever reason, time and again we see that the vital change comes from the populous. Indie rock, punk, hiphop, jazz-- these things were all profitable and artistically sound, as movements. Still, didn\'t bebop die because it got too avant garde? Instead we\'re left with Kenny G and muzak.\nThis \"Criminal Case\" is fine and all, but how vital is it to my life?

He lived most of the remaining 32 years of his life as a social outcast and his work faded into oblivion after his death in 1905. It has only recently been re-examined.\n\nSimeon, the youngest of eight children born to Meyer Solomon and Kathe Levey, was born on October 9, 1840. The Solomon family was the first Orthodox Jewish family permitted to conduct business in London during the nineteenth century.\n\n Solomon\'s father became a prominent merchant in the city. Kathe Levey was an artist, as were two of Simeon\'s siblings--his brother Abraham (1823-1862) and his sister Rebecca (1832-1886).\n\n At age ten Simeon began to take art lessons from Abraham, who had attended the Royal Academy of Art School. Two years later, Simeon attended Carey\'s Art Academy in the city and his sister, Rebecca, exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art for the first time.\n\n Four years later Simeon also premiered at the Royal Academy Summer Art Exhibition. His work continued to be shown in the same exhibition through 1872.\n\n Reflective of his Jewish background, Solomon\'s early works, such as Isaac Offered (1858), Saul (1859), Moses in His Mother\'s Arms (1860), Shadrach, Meschach and Abednego (1863), and Habet! (1865), were based on Hebrew themes. Some of these Hebraic paintings, such as David Playing the Harp before Saul (1859), portray sexually ambiguous situations.\n\nDuring 1857, Solomon met Pre-Raphaelite artists in the home of the group\'s leader, Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Among the artists and authors he met were Edward Burne-Jones, Frederic Leighton, William Morris, and Algernon Charles Swinburne.\n\n Solomon learned the group\'s manner of draftsmanship and designed some stained glass pieces for William Morris\'s firm, Morris, Marshall, and Faulkner and Co. The contact with the Pre-Raphaelites, especially Burne-Jones, probably influenced Solomon\'s adoption of a more androgynous figure style.\n\n By 1863 Solomon had also designed stained glass with Edward Burne-Jones for All Saints Church in Middleton and modeled for Rossetti\'s stained glass Sermon on the Mount at Christ Church in London.\n\nThe opening of the Dudley Gallery in London in 1865 allowed Solomon and other artists to exhibit works with more daring subjects than those accepted at the Royal Academy.\n\n During these years Solomon created such works of homoerotic content as Sappho and Erinna in a Garden at Mytelene (1864),  Love among the School Boys (1866), The Bride and Bridegroom (1866), Sad Love (1866),  Love in Autumn (1866), and two versions of  Bacchus (1866 and 1867).\n\n These works envision an alternative to straitened Victorian ideals of heterosexual love and matrimony. Solomon exhibited frequently at the Dudley Gallery through 1872.\n\nIn 1864 Solomon began a close friendship with Swinburne, whose own fascination with flagellation rites, lesbianism, and decadence provided a wealth of subject matter for Solomon. His illustrations for Swinburne\'s novel Lesbia Brandon (1865) and poem The Flogging Block (1865), for example, allowed Solomon to explore deeply transgressive subjects.\n\n In the late 1860s, Solomon began to travel to Italy in order to study the old masters. These trips stimulated his imagination and resulted in works on classical themes.\n\n During this period, Solomon moved away from his family\'s Judaism toward an interest in the Anglo-Catholic Church. The church\'s use of colorful vestments and altar linens, as well as stained glass and grand architecture, liturgy, and music, appealed to Solomon\'s aesthetic sense.\n\nDuring 1867, Solomon traveled to Italy as the lover of Oscar Browning, who was later to become headmaster of Eton and a don at Cambridge. The couple journeyed to Rome and Genoa again in 1870. While in the Mediterranean Simeon began to write his prose poem entitled A Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep.\n\n The 1870 trip, however, ended on a regrettable note. According to written accounts of some friends, the couple left the country earlier than planned. The trip\'s abrupt end may have been caused by legal reasons related to their same-sex relationship. If that is true, it is no coincidence that Simeon\'s troubles with alcohol began around this time.\n\nThe artist completed his prose poem when he returned to England, and it was privately published in 1871. The poem is a spiritual allegory that illuminates the iconography of Solomon\'s paintings and that may be read as a defense of homosexual relations. While the work won critical acclaim from John Addington Symonds, it was condemned by others and was never republished in England.\n\n Solomon, however, continued to create art. He exhibited three works at the Dudley Gallery and drew a portrait of critic Walter Pater in 1872.\n\n Then tragedy struck.\n\nThe artist was arrested on February 11, 1873 for having sex in a public lavatory with a sixty-year-old stableman, George Roberts. Both men were charged with indecent exposure and the attempt to commit \"buggery.\" They went to court thirteen days later, were judged guilty, fined one hundred pounds, and later sentenced to eighteen months in prison at hard labor.\n\n At the intervention of a wealthy cousin, Meyer Solomon, the artist\'s sentence was reduced to police supervision. (Roberts was not so fortunate.)\n\nEager to escape the shame he felt, Solomon traveled to France for a time. However, he was arrested there on March 4, 1874 for the same reasons. The French court fined him sixteen francs and sentenced him to three months in prison. The nineteen-year-old man he was with received a lesser sentence.\n\nAfter these legal experiences, the artist was never the same. Most London galleries, previous patrons, and former friends, including Swinburne, shunned him.\n\n He did receive some support: some gallery owners gave him monetary advances, one former patron remained loyal, some friends assisted him, and his cousin Meyer Solomon commissioned several paintings from him.\n\n Still, the artist remained depressed and became increasingly reliant on alcohol in an attempt to numb his shame and the pain of society\'s rejection.\n\nSolomon\'s depression was exacerbated by the loss of his livelihood and the deaths of immediate family members. His older brother and first art teacher, Abraham, had already died at the age of thirty-nine in 1862, on the same day that he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy. His older sister, Rebecca, a fellow artist, was in a fatal accident with a cab and died at the age of fifty-six on November 20, 1888. The following month his mother, also an artist, died of natural causes.\n\nSolomon continued to paint well into the mid-1890s. The works of the later period of his life are expressive of his feelings of hopelessness, alienation, fear of rejection, and thoughts of death. These themes are signaled by the titles of the works: Love at the Waters of Oblivion (1891), Tormented Soul (1894),  Death Awaiting Sleep (1896), and Twilight and Sleep (1897).\n\nSimeon spent his final years living alternately in the St. Giles Workhouse and on the street. He often was reduced to begging.\n\n He suffered a heart attack on May 25, 1905 and had a second one within three months. He died of heart failure aggravated by bronchitis and alcoholism on August 14, 1905.\n\n Even though he had forsaken his Jewish faith, he was buried in Willesden Jewish Cemetery.\n\nThe London Times did not publish an obituary, but the artist was not entirely forgotten. He was honored with an exhibition of 122 works at the Baillie Gallery from December 9, 1905 until January 13, 1906. Also in 1906, Burlington House in London held a retrospective exhibition of Simeon\'s work, and sixteen of his pieces were included in the 37th Winter Exhibition of Works of the Old Masters and Deceased Masters of the British School held at the Royal Academy.\n\nIn addition, sixteen of his works were included in a 1906 exhibition of works by Jewish artists at the Whitechapel Art Gallery.  Simeon Solomon, an Appreciation by Julia Ellsworth was published in New York in 1908.\n\nHowever, Simeon soon fell into neglect. His contribution to British art in general, and to the Pre-Raphaelite movement in particular, was lost to scholars for nearly a century.\n\nHe and his work have been re-examined through the lens of gender studies only during the 1990s.\n',NULL),(80,1,'e0eea1ac3f646241:1f796d0:fe102d1ef7:-7fd0','2004-07-30 09:13:42',121,'\n\nFace it dear, we\'re cut from the same cloth.

In the largest tree, within the fork whence the limbs divide, a fair, golden- haired woman stands and sings, with one white arm stretched along a branch of the tree, and with the other holding forth a bright red apple, as if to some one coming down the slope. Below her feet the trees grow more and more tangled, and stretch from both sides across the deep pit below: and the pit is full of the bodies of men.\nThey lie in heaps beneath the screen of boughs, with her apples bitten in their hands; and some are no more than ancient bones now, and some seem dead but yesterday. She stands over them in the glen, and sings for ever, and offers her apple still.\nThis dream shows me no strange place. I know the glen, and have known it from childhood, and heard many tales of those who have died there by the Siren\'s spell.\nI pass there often now, and look at it as one might look at a place chosen for one\'s grave. I see nothing, but I know that it means death for me. The apple-trees are like others, and have childish memories connected with them, though I was taught to shun the place.\nNo man sees the woman but once, and then no other is near; and no man sees that man again.\nOne day, in hunting, my dogs tracked the deer to that dell, and he fled and crouched under that tree, but the dogs would not go near him. And when I approached, he looked in my eyes as if to say, \"Here you shall die, and will you here give death?\" And his eyes seemed the eyes of my soul, and I called off the dogs, who were glad to follow me, and we left the deer to fly.\nI know that I must go there and hear the song and take the apple. I join with the young knights in their games; and have led our vassals and fought well. But all seems to me a dream, except what only I among them all shall see. Yet who knows? Is there one among them doomed like myself, and who is silent, like me? We shall not meet in the dell, for each man goes there alone: but in the pit we shall meet each other, and perhaps know.\nEach man who is the Siren\'s choice dreams the same dream, and always of some familiar spot wherever he lives in the world, and it is there that he finds her when his time comes. But when he sinks in the pit, it is the whole pomp of her dead gathered through the world that awaits him there; for all attend her to grace her triumph. Have they any souls out of those bodies? Or are the bodies still the house of the soul, the Siren\'s prey till the day of judgment?\nWe were ten brothers. One is gone there already. One day we looked for his return from a border foray, and his men came home without him, saying that he had told them he went to seek his love who would come to meet him by another road. But anon his love met them, asking for him; and they sought him vainly all that day. But in the night his love rose from a dream; and she went to the edge of the Siren\'s dell, and there lay his helmet and his sword. And her they sought in the morning, and there she lay dead. None has ever told this thing to my love, my sweet love who is affianced to me.\nOne day at table my love offered me an apple. And as I took it she laughed, and said, \"Do not eat, it is the fruit of the Siren\'s dell.\" And I laughed and ate: and at the heart of the apple was a red stain like a woman\'s mouth; and as I bit it I could feel a kiss upon my lips.\nThe same evening I walked with my love by that place, and she would needs have me sit with her under the apple-tree in which the Siren is said to stand. Then she stood in the hollow fork of the tree, and plucked an apple, and stretched it to me and would have sung: but at that moment she cried out, and leaped from the tree into my arms, and said that the leaves were whispering other words to her, and my name among them. She threw the apple to the bottom of the dell, and followed it with her eyes, to see how far it would fall, till it was hidden by the tangled boughs. And as we still looked, a little snake crept up through them.\nShe would needs go with me afterwards to pray in the church, where my ancestors and hers are buried; and she looked round on the effigies, and said, \"How long will it be before we lie here carved together?\" And I thought I heard the wind in the apple trees that seemed to whisper, \"How long?\"\nAnd late that night, when all were asleep, I went back to the dell, and said in my turn, \"How long?\" And for a moment I seemed to see a hand and apple stretched from the middle of the tree where my love had stood. And then it was gone: and I plucked the apples and bit them, and cast them in the pit, and said, \"Come.\"\nI speak of my love, and she loves me well; but I love her only as the stone whirling down the rapids loves the dead leaf that travels with it and clings to it, and that the same eddy will swallow up.\nLast night, at last, I dreamed how the end will come, and now I know it is near. I not only saw, in sleep, the lifelong pageant of the glen, but I took my part in it at last, and learned for certain why that dream was mine.\nI seemed to be walking with my love among the hills that lead downward to the glen: and still she said, \"It is late;\" but the wind was glenwards, and said, \"Hither.\" And still she said, \"Home grows far;\" but the rooks flew glenwards, and said, \"Hither.\" And still she said, \"Come back;\" but the sun had set, and the moon laboured towards the glen, and said, \"Hither.\" And my heart said in me, \"Aye, thither at last.\" Then we stood on the margin of the slope, with the apple-trees beneath us; and the moon bade the clouds fall from her, and sat in her throne like the sun at noon- day: and none of the apple-trees were bare now, though autumn was far worn, but fruit and blossom covered them together. And they were too thick to see through clearly; but looking far down I saw a white hand holding forth an apple, and heard the first notes of the Siren\'s song. Then my love clung to me and wept; but I began to struggle down the slope through the thick wall of bough and fruit and blossom, scattering them as the storm scatters the dead leaves; for that one apple only would my heart have. And my love snatched at me as I went; but the branches I thrust away sprang back on my path, and tore her hands and face: and the last I knew of her was the lifting of her hands to heaven as she cried aloud above me, while I still forced my way downwards. And now the Siren\'s song rose clearer as I went. At first she sang, \"Come to Love;\" and of the sweetness of Love she said many things. And next she sang, \"Come to Life;\" and Life was sweet in her song. But long before I reached her, she knew that all her will was mine: and then her voice rose softer than ever, and her words were, \"Come to Death;\" and Death\'s name in her mouth was the very swoon of all sweetest things that be. And then my path cleared; and she stood over against me in the fork of the tree I knew so well, blazing now like a lamp beneath the moon. And one kiss I had of her mouth, as I took the apple from her hand. But while I bit it, my brain whirled and my foot stumbled; and I felt my crashing fall through the tangled boughs beneath her feet, and saw the dead white faces that welcomed me in the pit. And so I woke cold in my bed: but it still seemed that I lay indeed at last among those who shall be my mates for ever, and could feel the apple still in my hand.',NULL),(84,2,'e0eea1ac3f646241:47a8f3:fe10806e6b:-7fed','2004-07-30 10:42:35',1,'LOVE AND SLEEP.\nLYING asleep between the strokes of night\nI saw my love lean over my sad bed,\nPale as the duskiest lily&rsquos leaf or head,\nSmooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite,\nToo wan for blushing and too warm for white,\nBut perfect-coloured without white or red.\nAnd her lips opened amorously, and said&mdash\nI wist not what, saving one word&mdashDelight.\nAnd all her face was honey to my mouth,\nAnd all her body pasture to mine eyes;\nThe long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire,\nThe quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south,\nThe bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs\nAnd glittering eyelids of my soul&rsquos desire.',NULL),(85,1,'f16e9ac2d35a9b9a:f824b7:fe11120549:-8000','2004-07-30 13:21:25',23,'\n\nA THING of beauty is a joy for ever:\n\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\n\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\n\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\n\nFull of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\n        5\n\nTherefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing\n\nA flowery band to bind us to the earth,\n\nSpite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\n\nOf noble natures, of the gloomy days,\n\nOf all the unhealthy and o?er-darkened ways\n        10\n\nMade for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\n\nSome shape of beauty moves away the pall\n\nFrom our dark spirits.

Paths there were many,\n\nWinding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,\n        80\n\nAnd ivy banks; all leading pleasantly\n\nTo a wide lawn, whence one could only see\n\nStems thronging all around between the swell\n\nOf turf and slanting branches: who could tell\n\nThe freshness of the space of heaven above,\n        85\n\nEdg?d round with dark tree tops? through which a dove\n\nWould often beat its wings, and often too\n\nA little cloud would move across the blue.\n\n \n\n  Full in the middle of this pleasantness\n\nThere stood a marble altar, with a tress\n        90\n\nOf flowers budded newly; and the dew\n\nHad taken fairy phantasies to strew\n\nDaisies upon the sacred sward last eve,\n\nAnd so the dawned light in pomp receive.\n\nFor ?twas the morn: Apollo?s upward fire\n        95\n\nMade every eastern cloud a silvery pyre\n\nOf brightness so unsullied, that therein\n\nA melancholy spirit well might win\n\nOblivion, and melt out his essence fine\n\nInto the winds: rain-scented eglantine\n        100\n\nGave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;\n\nThe lark was lost in him; cold springs had run\n\nTo warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;\n\nMan?s voice was on the mountains; and the mass\n\nOf nature?s lives and wonders puls?d tenfold,\n        105\n\nTo feel this sun-rise and its glories old.\n\n \n\n  Now while the silent workings of the dawn\n\nWere busiest, into that self-same lawn\n\nAll suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped\n\nA troop of little children garlanded;\n        110\n\nWho gathering round the altar, seemed to pry\n\nEarnestly round as wishing to espy\n\nSome folk of holiday: nor had they waited\n\nFor many moments, ere their ears were sated\n\nWith a faint breath of music, which ev?n then\n        115\n\nFill?d out its voice, and died away again.\n\nWithin a little space again it gave\n\nIts airy swellings, with a gentle wave,\n\nTo light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking\n\nThrough copse-clad vallies,?ere their death, oer-taking\n        120\n\nThe surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.\n\n \n\n  And now, as deep into the wood as we\n\nMight mark a lynx?s eye, there glimmered light\n\nFair faces and a rush of garments white,\n\nPlainer and plainer shewing, till at last\n        125\n\nInto the widest alley they all past,\n\nMaking directly for the woodland altar.\n\nO kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter\n\nIn telling of this goodly company,\n\nOf their old piety, and of their glee:\n        130\n\nBut let a portion of ethereal dew\n\nFall on my head, and presently unmew\n\nMy soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,\n\nTo stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.\n\n \n\n  Leading the way, young damsels danced along,\n        135\n\nBearing the burden of a shepherd song;\n\nEach having a white wicker over brimm?d\n\nWith April?s tender younglings: next, well trimm?d,\n\nA crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks\n\nAs may be read of in Arcadian books;\n        140\n\nSuch as sat listening round Apollo?s pipe,\n\nWhen the great deity, for earth too ripe,\n\nLet his divinity o?er-flowing die\n\nIn music, through the vales of Thessaly:\n\nSome idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,\n        145\n\nAnd some kept up a shrilly mellow sound\n\nWith ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,\n\nNow coming from beneath the forest trees,\n\nA venerable priest full soberly,\n\nBegirt with ministring looks: alway his eye\n        150\n\nStedfast upon the matted turf he kept,\n\nAnd after him his sacred vestments swept.\n\nFrom his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,\n\nOf mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;\n\nAnd in his left he held a basket full\n        155\n\nOf all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:\n\nWild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still\n\nThan Leda?s love, and cresses from the rill.\n\nHis aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,\n\nSeem?d like a poll of ivy in the teeth\n        160\n\nOf winter hoar. Then came another crowd\n\nOf shepherds, lifting in due time aloud\n\nTheir share of the ditty. After them appear?d,\n\nUp-followed by a multitude that rear?d\n\nTheir voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,\n        165\n\nEasily rolling so as scarce to mar\n\nThe freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:\n\nWho stood therein did seem of great renown\n\nAmong the throng. His youth was fully blown,\n\nShewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;\n        170\n\nAnd, for those simple times, his garments were\n\nA chieftain king?s: beneath his breast, half bare,\n\nWas hung a silver bugle, and between\n\nHis nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.\n\nA smile was on his countenance; he seem?d,\n        175\n\nTo common lookers on, like one who dream?d\n\nOf idleness in groves Elysian:\n\nBut there were some who feelingly could scan\n\nA lurking trouble in his nether lip,\n\nAnd see that oftentimes the reins would slip\n        180\n\nThrough his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,\n\nAnd think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,\n\nOf logs piled solemnly.?Ah, well-a-day,\n\nWhy should our young Endymion pine away!\n\n \n\n  Soon the assembly, in a circle rang?d,\n        185\n\nStood silent round the shrine: each look was chang?d\n\nTo sudden veneration: women meek\n\nBeckon?d their sons to silence; while each cheek\n\nOf virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.\n\nEndymion too, without a forest peer,\n        190\n\nStood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,\n\nAmong his brothers of the mountain chase.\n\nIn midst of all, the venerable priest\n\nEyed them with joy from greatest to the least,\n\nAnd, after lifting up his aged hands,\n        195\n\nThus spake he: ?Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!\n\nWhose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:\n\nWhether descended from beneath the rocks\n\nThat overtop your mountains; whether come\n\nFrom vallies where the pipe is never dumb;\n        200\n\nOr from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs\n\nBlue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze\n\nBuds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge\n\nNibble their fill at ocean?s very marge,\n\nWhose mellow reeds are touch?d with sounds forlorn\n        205\n\nBy the dim echoes of old Triton?s horn:\n\nMothers and wives! who day by day prepare\n\nThe scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;\n\nAnd all ye gentle girls who foster up\n\nUdderless lambs, and in a little cup\n        210\n\nWill put choice honey for a favoured youth:\n\nYea, every one attend! for in good truth\n\nOur vows are wanting to our great god Pan.\n\nAre not our lowing heifers sleeker than\n\nNight-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains\n        215\n\nSpeckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains\n\nGreen?d over April?s lap? No howling sad\n\nSickens our fearful ewes; and we have had\n\nGreat bounty from Endymion our lord.\n\nThe earth is glad: the merry lark has pour?d\n        220\n\nHis early song against yon breezy sky,\n\nThat spreads so clear o?er our solemnity.?\n\n \n\n  Thus ending, on the shrine he heap?d a spire\n\nOf teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;\n\nAnon he stain?d the thick and spongy sod\n        225\n\nWith wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.\n\nNow while the earth was drinking it, and while\n\nBay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,\n\nAnd gummy frankincense was sparkling bright\n\n?Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light\n        230\n\nSpread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:\n\n \n\n  ?O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang\n\nFrom jagged trunks, and overshadoweth\n\nEternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death\n\nOf unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;\n        235\n\nWho lov?st to see the hamadryads dress\n\nTheir ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;\n\nAnd through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken\n\nThe dreary melody of bedded reeds?\n\nIn desolate places, where dank moisture breeds\n        240\n\nThe pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;\n\nBethinking thee, how melancholy loth\n\nThou wast to lose fair Syrinx?do thou now,\n\nBy thy love?s milky brow!\n\nBy all the trembling mazes that she ran,\n        245\n\nHear us, great Pan!\n\n \n\n  ?O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles\n\nPassion their voices cooingly ?mong myrtles,\n\nWhat time thou wanderest at eventide\n\nThrough sunny meadows, that outskirt the side\n        250\n\nOf thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom\n\nBroad leaved fig trees even now foredoom\n\nTheir ripen?d fruitage; yellow girted bees\n\nTheir golden honeycombs; our village leas\n\nTheir fairest-blossom?d beans and poppied corn;\n        255\n\nThe chuckling linnet its five young unborn,\n\nTo sing for thee; low creeping strawberries\n\nTheir summer coolness; pent up butterflies\n\nTheir freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year\n\nAll its completions?be quickly near,\n        260\n\nBy every wind that nods the mountain pine,\n\nO forester divine!\n\n \n\n  ?Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies\n\nFor willing service; whether to surprise\n\nThe squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;\n        265\n\nOr upward ragged precipices flit\n\nTo save poor lambkins from the eagle?s maw;\n\nOr by mysterious enticement draw\n\nBewildered shepherds to their path again;\n\nOr to tread breathless round the frothy main,\n        270\n\nAnd gather up all fancifullest shells\n\nFor thee to tumble into Naiads? cells,\n\nAnd, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;\n\nOr to delight thee with fantastic leaping,\n\nThe while they pelt each other on the crown\n        275\n\nWith silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown?\n\nBy all the echoes that about thee ring,\n\nHear us, O satyr king!\n\n \n\n  ?O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,\n\nWhile ever and anon to his shorn peers\n        280\n\nA ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,\n\nWhen snouted wild-boars routing tender corn\n\nAnger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,\n\nTo keep off mildews, and all weather harms:\n\nStrange ministrant of undescribed sounds,\n        285\n\nThat come a swooning over hollow grounds,\n\nAnd wither drearily on barren moors:\n\nDread opener of the mysterious doors\n\nLeading to universal knowledge?see,\n\nGreat son of Dryope,\n        290\n\nThe many that are come to pay their vows\n\nWith leaves about their brows!\n\n \n\n  Be still the unimaginable lodge\n\nFor solitary thinkings; such as dodge\n\nConception to the very bourne of heaven,\n        295\n\nThen leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,\n\nThat spreading in this dull and clodded earth\n\nGives it a touch ethereal?a new birth:\n\nBe still a symbol of immensity;\n\nA firmament reflected in a sea;\n        300\n\nAn element filling the space between;\n\nAn unknown?but no more: we humbly screen\n\nWith uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,\n\nAnd giving out a shout most heaven rending,\n\nConjure thee to receive our humble Paean,\n        305\n\nUpon thy Mount Lycean!\n\n \n\n  Even while they brought the burden to a close,\n\nA shout from the whole multitude arose,\n\nThat lingered in the air like dying rolls\n\nOf abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals\n        310\n\nOf dolphins bob their noses through the brine.\n\nMeantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,\n\nYoung companies nimbly began dancing\n\nTo the swift treble pipe, and humming string.\n\nAye, those fair living forms swam heavenly\n        315\n\nTo tunes forgotten?out of memory:\n\nFair creatures! whose young children?s children bred\n\nThermopylæ its heroes?not yet dead,\n\nBut in old marbles ever beautiful.\n\nHigh genitors, unconscious did they cull\n        320\n\nTime?s sweet first-fruits?they danc?d to weariness,\n\nAnd then in quiet circles did they press\n\nThe hillock turf, and caught the latter end\n\nOf some strange history, potent to send\n\nA young mind from its bodily tenement.\n        325\n\nOr they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent\n\nOn either side; pitying the sad death\n\nOf Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath\n\nOf Zephyr slew him,?Zephyr penitent,\n\nWho now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,\n        330\n\nFondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.\n\nThe archers too, upon a wider plain,\n\nBeside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,\n\nAnd the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft\n\nBranch down sweeping from a tall ash top,\n        335\n\nCall?d up a thousand thoughts to envelope\n\nThose who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee\n\nAnd frantic gape of lonely Niobe,\n\nPoor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young\n\nWere dead and gone, and her caressing tongue\n        340\n\nLay a lost thing upon her paly lip,\n\nAnd very, very deadliness did nip\n\nHer motherly cheeks. Arous?d from this sad mood\n\nBy one, who at a distance loud halloo?d,\n\nUplifting his strong bow into the air,\n        345\n\nMany might after brighter visions stare:\n\nAfter the Argonauts, in blind amaze\n\nTossing about on Neptune?s restless ways,\n\nUntil, from the horizon?s vaulted side,\n\nThere shot a golden splendour far and wide,\n        350\n\nSpangling those million poutings of the brine\n\nWith quivering ore: ?twas even an awful shine\n\nFrom the exaltation of Apollo?s bow;\n\nA heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.\n\nWho thus were ripe for high contemplating,\n        355\n\nMight turn their steps towards the sober ring\n\nWhere sat Endymion and the aged priest\n\n?Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas?d\n\nThe silvery setting of their mortal star.\n\nThere they discours?d upon the fragile bar\n        360\n\nThat keeps us from our homes ethereal;\n\nAnd what our duties there: to nightly call\n\nVesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;\n\nTo summon all the downiest clouds together\n\nFor the sun?s purple couch; to emulate\n        365\n\nIn ministring the potent rule of fate\n\nWith speed of fire-tailed exhalations;\n\nTo tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons\n\nSweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,\n\nA world of other unguess?d offices.\n        370\n\nAnon they wander?d, by divine converse,\n\nInto Elysium; vieing to rehearse\n\nEach one his own anticipated bliss.\n\nOne felt heart-certain that he could not miss\n\nHis quick gone love, among fair blossom?d boughs,\n        375\n\nWhere every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows\n\nHer lips with music for the welcoming.\n\nAnother wish?d, mid that eternal spring,\n\nTo meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,\n\nSweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:\n        380\n\nWho, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,\n\nAnd with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;\n\nAnd, ever after, through those regions be\n\nHis messenger, his little Mercury.\n\nSome were athirst in soul to see again\n        385\n\nTheir fellow huntsmen o?er the wide champaign\n\nIn times long past; to sit with them, and talk\n\nOf all the chances in their earthly walk;\n\nComparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores\n\nOf happiness, to when upon the moors,\n        390\n\nBenighted, close they huddled from the cold,\n\nAnd shar?d their famish?d scrips. Thus all out-told\n\nTheir fond imaginations,?saving him\n\nWhose eyelids curtain?d up their jewels dim,\n\nEndymion: yet hourly had he striven\n        395\n\nTo hide the cankering venom, that had riven\n\nHis fainting recollections. Now indeed\n\nHis senses had swoon?d off: he did not heed\n\nThe sudden silence, or the whispers low,\n\nOr the old eyes dissolving at his woe,\n        400\n\nOr anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,\n\nOr maiden?s sigh, that grief itself embalms:\n\nBut in the self-same fixed trance he kept,\n\nLike one who on the earth had never stept.\n\nAye, even as dead-still as a marble man,\n        405\n\nFrozen in that old tale Arabian.\n\n \n\n  Who whispers him so pantingly and close?\n\nPeona, his sweet sister: of all those,\n\nHis friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,\n\nAnd breath?d a sister?s sorrow to persuade\n        410\n\nA yielding up, a cradling on her care.\n\nHer eloquence did breathe away the curse:\n\nShe led him, like some midnight spirit nurse\n\nOf happy changes in emphatic dreams,\n\nAlong a path between two little streams,?\n        415\n\nGuarding his forehead, with her round elbow,\n\nFrom low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow\n\nFrom stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;\n\nUntil they came to where these streamlets fall,\n\nWith mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,\n        420\n\nInto a river, clear, brimful, and flush\n\nWith crystal mocking of the trees and sky.\n\nA little shallop, floating there hard by,\n\nPointed its beak over the fringed bank;\n\nAnd soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,\n        425\n\nAnd dipt again, with the young couple?s weight,?\n\nPeona guiding, through the water straight,\n\nTowards a bowery island opposite;\n\nWhich gaining presently, she steered light\n\nInto a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,\n        430\n\nWhere nested was an arbour, overwove\n\nBy many a summer?s silent fingering;\n\nTo whose cool bosom she was used to bring\n\nHer playmates, with their needle broidery,\n\nAnd minstrel memories of times gone by.\n        435\n\n \n\n  So she was gently glad to see him laid\n\nUnder her favourite bower?s quiet shade,\n\nOn her own couch, new made of flower leaves,\n\nDried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves\n\nWhen last the sun his autumn tresses shook,\n        440\n\nAnd the tann?d harvesters rich armfuls took.\n\nSoon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:\n\nBut, ere it crept upon him, he had prest\n\nPeona?s busy hand against his lips,\n\nAnd still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips\n        445\n\nIn tender pressure. And as a willow keeps\n\nA patient watch over the stream that creeps\n\nWindingly by it, so the quiet maid\n\nHeld her in peace: so that a whispering blade\n\nOf grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling\n        450\n\nDown in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling\n\nAmong seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.\n\n \n\n  O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,\n\nThat broodest o?er the troubled sea of the mind\n\nTill it is hush?d and smooth! O unconfin?d\n        455\n\nRestraint! imprisoned liberty! great key\n\nTo golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,\n\nFountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,\n\nEchoing grottos, full of tumbling waves\n\nAnd moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world\n        460\n\nOf silvery enchantment!?who, upfurl?d\n\nBeneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,\n\nBut renovates and lives??Thus, in the bower,\n\nEndymion was calm?d to life again.\n\nOpening his eyelids with a healthier brain,\n        465\n\nHe said: ?I feel this thine endearing love\n\nAll through my bosom: thou art as a dove\n\nTrembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings\n\nAbout me; and the pearliest dew not brings\n\nSuch morning incense from the fields of May,\n        470\n\nAs do those brighter drops that twinkling stray\n\nFrom those kind eyes,?the very home and haunt\n\nOf sisterly affection. Can I want\n\nAught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?\n\nYet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears\n        475\n\nThat, any longer, I will pass my days\n\nAlone and sad. No, I will once more raise\n\nMy voice upon the mountain-heights; once more\n\nMake my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:\n\nAgain my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll\n        480\n\nAround the breathed boar: again I?ll poll\n\nThe fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:\n\nAnd, when the pleasant sun is getting low,\n\nAgain I?ll linger in a sloping mead\n\nTo hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed\n        485\n\nOur idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,\n\nAnd, if thy lute is here, softly intreat\n\nMy soul to keep in its resolved course.?\n\n \n\n  Hereat Peona, in their silver source,\n\nShut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,\n        490\n\nAnd took a lute, from which there pulsing came\n\nA lively prelude, fashioning the way\n\nIn which her voice should wander. ?Twas a lay\n\nMore subtle cadenced, more forest wild\n\nThan Dryope?s lone lulling of her child;\n        495\n\nAnd nothing since has floated in the air\n\nSo mournful strange. Surely some influence rare\n\nWent, spiritual, through the damsel?s hand;\n\nFor still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann?d\n\nThe quick invisible strings, even though she saw\n        500\n\nEndymion?s spirit melt away and thaw\n\nBefore the deep intoxication.\n\nBut soon she came, with sudden burst, upon\n\nHer self-possession?swung the lute aside,\n\nAnd earnestly said: ?Brother, ?tis vain to hide\n        505\n\nThat thou dost know of things mysterious,\n\nImmortal, starry; such alone could thus\n\nWeigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn?d in aught\n\nOffensive to the heavenly powers? Caught\n\nA Paphian dove upon a message sent?\n        510\n\nThy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,\n\nSacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen\n\nHer naked limbs among the alders green;\n\nAnd that, alas! is death. No, I can trace\n\nSomething more high perplexing in thy face!?\n        515\n\n \n\n  Endymion look?d at her, and press?d her hand,\n\nAnd said, ?Art thou so pale, who wast so bland\n\nAnd merry in our meadows? How is this?\n\nTell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!?\n\nAh! thou hast been unhappy at the change\n        520\n\nWrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?\n\nOr more complete to overwhelm surmise?\n\nAmbition is no sluggard: ?tis no prize,\n\nThat toiling years would put within my grasp,\n\nThat I have sigh?d for: with so deadly gasp\n        525\n\nNo man e?er panted for a mortal love.\n\nSo all have set my heavier grief above\n\nThese things which happen. Rightly have they done:\n\nI, who still saw the horizontal sun\n\nHeave his broad shoulder o?er the edge of the world,\n        530\n\nOut-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl?d\n\nMy spear aloft, as signal for the chace?\n\nI, who, for very sport of heart, would race\n\nWith my own steed from Araby; pluck down\n\nA vulture from his towery perching; frown\n        535\n\nA lion into growling, loth retire?\n\nTo lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,\n\nAnd sink thus low! but I will ease my breast\n\nOf secret grief, here in this bowery nest.\n\n \n\n  ?This river does not see the naked sky,\n        540\n\nTill it begins to progress silverly\n\nAround the western border of the wood,\n\nWhence, from a certain spot, its winding flood\n\nSeems at the distance like a crescent moon:\n\nAnd in that nook, the very pride of June,\n        545\n\nHad I been used to pass my weary eves;\n\nThe rather for the sun unwilling leaves\n\nSo dear a picture of his sovereign power,\n\nAnd I could witness his most kingly hour,\n\nWhen he doth lighten up the golden reins,\n        550\n\nAnd paces leisurely down amber plains\n\nHis snorting four. Now when his chariot last\n\nIts beams against the zodiac-lion cast,\n\nThere blossom?d suddenly a magic bed\n\nOf sacred ditamy, and poppies red:\n        555\n\nAt which I wondered greatly, knowing well\n\nThat but one night had wrought this flowery spell;\n\nAnd, sitting down close by, began to muse\n\nWhat it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,\n\nIn passing here, his owlet pinions shook;\n        560\n\nOr, it may be, ere matron Night uptook\n\nHer ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,\n\nHad dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth\n\nCame not by common growth. Thus on I thought,\n\nUntil my head was dizzy and distraught.\n        565\n\nMoreover, through the dancing poppies stole\n\nA breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;\n\nAnd shaping visions all about my sight\n\nOf colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;\n\nThe which became more strange, and strange, and dim,\n        570\n\nAnd then were gulph?d in a tumultuous swim:\n\nAnd then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell\n\nThe enchantment that afterwards befel?\n\nYet it was but a dream: yet such a dream\n\nThat never tongue, although it overteem\n        575\n\nWith mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,\n\nCould figure out and to conception bring\n\nAll I beheld and felt. Methought I lay\n\nWatching the zenith, where the milky way\n\nAmong the stars in virgin splendour pours;\n        580\n\nAnd travelling my eye, until the doors\n\nOf heaven appear?d to open for my flight,\n\nI became loth and fearful to alight\n\nFrom such high soaring by a downward glance:\n\nSo kept me stedfast in that airy trance,\n        585\n\nSpreading imaginary pinions wide.\n\nWhen, presently, the stars began to glide,\n\nAnd faint away, before my eager view:\n\nAt which I sigh?d that I could not pursue,\n\nAnd dropt my vision to the horizon?s verge;\n        590\n\nAnd lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge\n\nThe loveliest moon, that ever silver?d o?er\n\nA shell for Neptune?s goblet: she did soar\n\nSo passionately bright, my dazzled soul\n\nCommingling with her argent spheres did roll\n        595\n\nThrough clear and cloudy, even when she went\n\nAt last into a dark and vapoury tent?\n\nWhereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train\n\nOf planets all were in the blue again.\n\nTo commune with those orbs, once more I rais?d\n        600\n\nMy sight right upward: but it was quite dazed\n\nBy a bright something, sailing down apace,\n\nMaking me quickly veil my eyes and face:\n\nAgain I look?d, and, O ye deities,\n\nWho from Olympus watch our destinies!\n        605\n\nWhence that completed form of all completeness?\n\nWhence came that high perfection of all sweetness?\n\nSpeak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where\n\nHast thou a symbol of her golden hair?\n\nNot oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;\n        610\n\nNot?thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun\n\nSuch follying before thee?yet she had,\n\nIndeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;\n\nAnd they were simply gordian?d up and braided,\n\nLeaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,\n        615\n\nHer pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;\n\nThe which were blended in, I know not how,\n\nWith such a paradise of lips and eyes,\n\nBlush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,\n\nThat, when I think thereon, my spirit clings\n        620\n\nAnd plays about its fancy, till the stings\n\nOf human neighbourhood envenom all.\n\nUnto what awful power shall I call?\n\nTo what high fane??Ah! see her hovering feet,\n\nMore bluely vein?d, more soft, more whitely sweet\n        625\n\nThan those of sea-born Venus, when she rose\n\nFrom out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows\n\nHer scarf into a fluttering pavilion;\n\n?Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million\n\nOf little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,\n        630\n\nOver the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,\n\nHandfuls of daisies.???Endymion, how strange!\n\nDream within dream!???She took an airy range,\n\nAnd then, towards me, like a very maid,\n\nCame blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,\n        635\n\nAnd press?d me by the hand: Ah! ?twas too much;\n\nMethought I fainted at the charmed touch,\n\nYet held my recollection, even as one\n\nWho dives three fathoms where the waters run\n\nGurgling in beds of coral: for anon,\n        640\n\nI felt upmounted in that region\n\nWhere falling stars dart their artillery forth,\n\nAnd eagles struggle with the buffeting north\n\nThat balances the heavy meteor-stone;?\n\nFelt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,\n        645\n\nBut lapp?d and lull?d along the dangerous sky.\n\nSoon, as it seem?d, we left our journeying high,\n\nAnd straightway into frightful eddies swoop?d;\n\nSuch as ay muster where grey time has scoop?d\n\nHuge dens and caverns in a mountain?s side:\n        650\n\nThere hollow sounds arous?d me, and I sigh?d\n\nTo faint once more by looking on my bliss?\n\nI was distracted; madly did I kiss\n\nThe wooing arms which held me, and did give\n\nMy eyes at once to death: but ?twas to live,\n        655\n\nTo take in draughts of life from the gold fount\n\nOf kind and passionate looks; to count, and count\n\nThe moments, by some greedy help that seem?d\n\nA second self, that each might be redeem?d\n\nAnd plunder?d of its load of blessedness.\n        660\n\nAh, desperate mortal! I ev?n dar?d to press\n\nHer very cheek against my crowned lip,\n\nAnd, at that moment, felt my body dip\n\nInto a warmer air: a moment more,\n\nOur feet were soft in flowers. There was store\n        665\n\nOf newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes\n\nA scent of violets, and blossoming limes,\n\nLoiter?d around us; then of honey cells,\n\nMade delicate from all white-flower bells;\n\nAnd once, above the edges of our nest,\n        670\n\nAn arch face peep?d,?an Oread as I guess?d.\n\n \n\n  ?Why did I dream that sleep o?er-power?d me\n\nIn midst of all this heaven? Why not see,\n\nFar off, the shadows of his pinions dark,\n\nAnd stare them from me? But no, like a spark\n        675\n\nThat needs must die, although its little beam\n\nReflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream\n\nFell into nothing?into stupid sleep.\n\nAnd so it was, until a gentle creep,\n\nA careful moving caught my waking ears,\n        680\n\nAnd up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,\n\nMy clenched hands;?for lo! the poppies hung\n\nDew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung\n\nA heavy ditty, and the sullen day\n\nHad chidden herald Hesperus away,\n        685\n\nWith leaden looks: the solitary breeze\n\nBluster?d, and slept, and its wild self did teaze\n\nWith wayward melancholy; and r thought,\n\nMark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought\n\nFaint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!?\n        690\n\nAway I wander?d?all the pleasant hues\n\nOf heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades\n\nWere deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades\n\nWere full of pestilent light; our taintless rills\n\nSeem?d sooty, and o?er-spread with upturn?d gills\n        695\n\nOf dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown\n\nIn frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown\n\nLike spiked aloe. If an innocent bird\n\nBefore my heedless footsteps stirr?d, and stirr?d\n\nIn little journeys, I beheld in it\n        700\n\nA disguis?d demon, missioned to knit\n\nMy soul with under darkness; to entice\n\nMy stumblings down some monstrous precipice:\n\nTherefore I eager followed, and did curse\n\nThe disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,\n        705\n\nRock?d me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!\n\nThese things, with all their comfortings, are given\n\nTo my down-sunken hours, and with thee,\n\nSweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea\n\nOf weary life.?\n\n                  Thus ended he, and both\n        710\n\nSat silent: for the maid was very loth\n\nTo answer; feeling well that breathed words\n\nWould all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords\n\nAgainst the enchased crocodile, or leaps\n\nOf grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,\n        715\n\nAnd wonders; struggles to devise some blame;\n\nTo put on such a look as would say, Shame\n\nOn this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,\n\nShe could as soon have crush?d away the life\n\nFrom a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,\n        720\n\nShe said with trembling chance: ?Is this the cause?\n\nThis all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!\n\nThat one who through this middle earth should pass\n\nMost like a sojourning demi-god, and leave\n\nHis name upon the harp-string, should achieve\n        725\n\nNo higher bard than simple maidenhood,\n\nSinging alone, and fearfully,?how the blood\n\nLeft his young cheek; and how he used to stray\n\nHe knew not where; and how he would say, nay,\n\nIf any said ?twas love: and yet ?twas love;\n        730\n\nWhat could it be but love? How a ring-dove\n\nLet fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;\n\nAnd how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,\n\nThe gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;\n\nAnd then the ballad of his sad life closes\n        735\n\nWith sighs, and an alas!?Endymion!\n\nBe rather in the trumpet?s mouth,?anon\n\nAmong the winds at large?that all may hearken!\n\nAlthough, before the crystal heavens darken,\n\nI watch and dote upon the silver lakes\n        740\n\nPictur?d in western cloudiness, that takes\n\nThe semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,\n\nIslands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands\n\nWith horses prancing o?er them, palaces\n\nAnd towers of amethyst,?would I so tease\n        745\n\nMy pleasant days, because I could not mount\n\nInto those regions? The Morphean fount\n\nOf that fine element that visions, dreams,\n\nAnd fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams\n\nInto its airy channels with so subtle,\n        750\n\nSo thin a breathing, not the spider?s shuttle,\n\nCircled a million times within the space\n\nOf a swallow?s nest-door, could delay a trace,\n\nA tinting of its quality: how light\n\nMust dreams themselves be; seeing they?re more slight\n        755\n\nThan the mere nothing that engenders them!\n\nThen wherefore sully the entrusted gem\n\nOf high and noble life with thoughts so sick?\n\nWhy pierce high-fronted honour to the quick\n\nFor nothing but a dream?? Hereat the youth\n        760\n\nLook?d up: a conflicting of shame and ruth\n\nWas in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids\n\nWidened a little, as when Zephyr bids\n\nA little breeze to creep between the fans\n\nOf careless butterflies: amid his pains\n        765\n\nHe seem?d to taste a drop of manna-dew,\n\nFull palatable; and a colour grew\n\nUpon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.\n\n \n\n  ?Peona! ever have I long?d to slake\n\nMy thirst for the world?s praises: nothing base,\n        770\n\nNo merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace\n\nThe stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar?d?\n\nThough now ?tis tatter?d; leaving my bark bar?d\n\nAnd sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope\n\nIs of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,\n        775\n\nTo fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.\n\nWherein lies happiness? In that which becks\n\nOur ready minds to fellowship divine,\n\nA fellowship with essence; till we shine,\n\nFull alchemiz?d, and free of space. Behold\n        780\n\nThe clear religion of heaven! Fold\n\nA rose leaf round thy finger?s taperness,\n\nAnd soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress\n\nOf music?s kiss impregnates the free winds,\n\nAnd with a sympathetic touch unbinds\n        785\n\nEolian magic from their lucid wombs:\n\nThen old songs waken from enclouded tombs;\n\nOld ditties sigh above their father?s grave;\n\nGhosts of melodious prophecyings rave\n\nRound every spot where trod Apollo?s foot;\n        790\n\nBronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,\n\nWhere long ago a giant battle was;\n\nAnd, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass\n\nIn every place where infant Orpheus slept.\n\nFeel we these things??that moment have we stept\n        795\n\nInto a sort of oneness, and our state\n\nIs like a floating spirit?s. But there are\n\nRicher entanglements, enthralments far\n\nMore self-destroying, leading, by degrees,\n\nTo the chief intensity: the crown of these\n        800\n\nIs made of love and friendship, and sits high\n\nUpon the forehead of humanity.\n\nAll its more ponderous and bulky worth\n\nIs friendship, whence there ever issues forth\n\nA steady splendour; but at the tip-top,\n        805\n\nThere hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop\n\nOf light, and that is love: its influence,\n\nThrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,\n\nAt which we start and fret; till in the end,\n\nMelting into its radiance, we blend,\n        810\n\nMingle, and so become a part of it,?\n\nNor with aught else can our souls interknit\n\nSo wingedly: when we combine therewith,\n\nLife?s self is nourish?d by its proper pith,\n\nAnd we are nurtured like a pelican brood.\n        815\n\nAye, so delicious is the unsating food,\n\nThat men, who might have tower?d in the van\n\nOf all the congregated world, to fan\n\nAnd winnow from the coming step of time\n\nAll chaff of custom, wipe away all slime\n        820\n\nLeft by men-slugs and human serpentry,\n\nHave been content to let occasion die,\n\nWhilst they did sleep in love?s elysium.\n\nAnd, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,\n\nThan speak against this ardent listlessness:\n        825\n\nFor I have ever thought that it might bless\n\nThe world with benefits unknowingly;\n\nAs does the nightingale, upperched high,\n\nAnd cloister?d among cool and bunched leaves?\n\nShe sings but to her love, nor e?er conceives\n        830\n\nHow tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.\n\nJust so may love, although ?tis understood\n\nThe mere commingling of passionate breath,\n\nProduce more than our searching witnesseth:\n\nWhat I know not: but who, of men, can tell\n        835\n\nThat flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell\n\nTo melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,\n\nThe earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,\n\nThe meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,\n\nThe seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,\n        840\n\nTones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,\n\nIf human souls did never kiss and greet?\n\n \n\n  ?Now, if this earthly love has power to make\n\nMen?s being mortal, immortal; to shake\n\nAmbition from their memories, and brim\n        845\n\nTheir measure of content; what merest whim,\n\nSeems all this poor endeavour after fame,\n\nTo one, who keeps within his stedfast aim\n\nA love immortal, an immortal too.\n\nLook not so wilder?d; for these things are true,\n        850\n\nAnd never can be born of atomies\n\nThat buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,\n\nLeaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I?m sure,\n\nMy restless spirit never could endure\n\nTo brood so long upon one luxury,\n        855\n\nUnless it did, though fearfully, espy\n\nA hope beyond the shadow of a dream.\n\nMy sayings will the less obscured seem,\n\nWhen I have told thee how my waking sight\n\nHas made me scruple whether that same night\n        860\n\nWas pass?d in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!\n\nBeyond the matron-temple of Latona,\n\nWhich we should see but for these darkening boughs,\n\nLies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows\n\nBushes and trees do lean all round athwart,\n        865\n\nAnd meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,\n\nAnd spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide\n\nPast them, but he must brush on every side.\n\nSome moulder?d steps lead into this cool cell,\n\nFar as the slabbed margin of a well,\n        870\n\nWhose patient level peeps its crystal eye\n\nRight upward, through the bushes, to the sky.\n\nOft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set\n\nLike vestal primroses, but dark velvet\n\nEdges them round, and they have golden pits:\n        875\n\n?Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits\n\nIn a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,\n\nWhen all above was faint with mid-day heat.\n\nAnd there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,\n\nI?d bubble up the water through a reed;\n        880\n\nSo reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships\n\nOf moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,\n\nWith leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be\n\nOf their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,\n\nWhen love-lorn hours had left me less a child,\n        885\n\nI sat contemplating the figures wild\n\nOf o?er-head clouds melting the mirror through.\n\nUpon a day, while thus I watch?d, by flew\n\nA cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;\n\nSo plainly character?d, no breeze would shiver\n        890\n\nThe happy chance: so happy, I was fain\n\nTo follow it upon the open plain,\n\nAnd, therefore, was just going; when, behold!\n\nA wonder, fair as any I have told?\n\nThe same bright face I tasted in my sleep,\n        895\n\nSmiling in the clear well. My heart did leap\n\nThrough the cool depth.?It moved as if to flee?\n\nI started up, when lo! refreshfully,\n\nThere came upon my face, in plenteous showers,\n\nDew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,\n        900\n\nWrapping all objects from my smothered sight,\n\nBathing my spirit in a new delight.\n\nAye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss\n\nAlone preserved me from the drear abyss\n\nOf death, for the fair form had gone again.\n        905\n\nPleasure is oft a visitant; but pain\n\nClings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth\n\nOn the deer?s tender haunches: late, and loth,\n\n?Tis scar?d away by slow returning pleasure.\n\nHow sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure\n        910\n\nOf weary days, made deeper exquisite,\n\nBy a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!\n\nLike sorrow came upon me, heavier still,\n\nThan when I wander?d from the poppy hill:\n\nAnd a whole age of lingering moments crept\n        915\n\nSluggishly by, ere more contentment swept\n\nAway at once the deadly yellow spleen.\n\nYes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;\n\nOnce more been tortured with renewed life.\n\nWhen last the wintry gusts gave over strife\n        920\n\nWith the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies\n\nWarm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes\n\nIn pity of the shatter?d infant buds,?\n\nThat time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,\n\nMy hunting cap, because I laugh?d and smil?d,\n        925\n\nChatted with thee, and many days exil?d\n\nAll torment from my breast;??twas even then,\n\nStraying about, yet, coop?d up in the den\n\nOf helpless discontent,?hurling my lance\n\nFrom place to place, and following at chance,\n        930\n\nAt last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,\n\nAnd, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck\n\nIn the middle of a brook,?whose silver ramble\n\nDown twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,\n\nTracing along, it brought me to a cave,\n        935\n\nWhence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave\n\nThe nether sides of mossy stones and rock,?\n\n?Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock\n\nIts own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,\n\nHung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread\n        940\n\nThick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph?s home.\n\n?Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam??\n\nSaid I, low voic?d: ?Ah whither! ?Tis the grot\n\nOf Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,\n\nDoth her resign; and where her tender hands\n        945\n\nShe dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:\n\nOr ?tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,\n\nAnd babbles thorough silence, till her wits\n\nAre gone in tender madness, and anon,\n\nFaints into sleep, with many a dying tone\n        950\n\nOf sadness. O that she would take my vows,\n\nAnd breathe them sighingly among the boughs,\n\nTo sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,\n\nDaily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,\n\nAnd weave them dyingly?send honey-whispers\n        955\n\nRound every leaf, that all those gentle lispers\n\nMay sigh my love unto her pitying!\n\nO charitable echo! hear, and sing\n\nThis ditty to her!?tell her??so I stay?d\n\nMy foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,\n        960\n\nStood stupefied with my own empty folly,\n\nAnd blushing for the freaks of melancholy.\n\nSalt tears were coming, when I heard my name\n\nMost fondly lipp?d, and then these accents came:\n\n?Endymion! the cave is secreter\n        965\n\nThan the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir\n\nNo sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise\n\nOf thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys\n\nAnd trembles through my labyrinthine hair.?\n\nAt that oppress?d I hurried in.?Ah! where\n        970\n\nAre those swift moments? Whither are they fled?\n\nI?ll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed\n\nSorrow the way to death, but patiently\n\nBear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;\n\nAnd come instead demurest meditation,\n        975\n\nTo occupy me wholly, and to fashion\n\nMy pilgrimage for the world?s dusky brink.\n\nNo more will I count over, link by link,\n\nMy chain of grief: no longer strive to find\n\nA half-forgetfulness in mountain wind\n        980\n\nBlustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,\n\nDearest of sisters, what my life shall be;\n\nWhat a calm round of hours shall make my days.\n\nThere is a paly flame of hope that plays\n\nWhere?er I look: but yet, I?ll say ?tis naught?\n        985\n\nAnd here I bid it die. Have not I caught,\n\nAlready, a more healthy countenance?\n\nBy this the sun is setting; we may chance\n\nMeet some of our near-dwellers with my car.?\n\n \n\n  This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star\n        990\n\nThrough autumn mists, and took Peona?s hand:\n\nThey stept into the boat, and launch?d from land.\n\n \n\n\n \n',NULL),(86,2,'f16e9ac2d35a9b9a:f824b7:fe11120549:-7ff9','2004-07-30 13:24:03',22,' \n\nA THING of beauty is a joy for ever:\n\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\n\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\n\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\n\nFull of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\n        5\n\nTherefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing\n\nA flowery band to bind us to the earth,\n\nSpite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\n\nOf noble natures, of the gloomy days,\n\nOf all the unhealthy and o?er-darkened ways\n        10\n\nMade for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\n\nSome shape of beauty moves away the pall\n\nFrom our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\n\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\n\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\n        15\n\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\n\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\n\n?Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,\n\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\n\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\n        20\n\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\n\nAll lovely tales that we have heard or read:\n\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\n\nPouring unto us from the heaven?s brink.\n\n \n\n  Nor do we merely feel these essences\n        25\n\nFor one short hour; no, even as the trees\n\nThat whisper round a temple become soon\n\nDear as the temple?s self, so does the moon,\n\nThe passion poesy, glories infinite,\n\nHaunt us till they become a cheering light\n        30\n\nUnto our souls, and bound to us so fast,\n\nThat, whether there be shine, or gloom o?ercast,\n\nThey alway must be with us, or we die.\n\n \n\n  Therefore, ?tis with full happiness that I\n\nWill trace the story of Endymion.\n        35\n\nThe very music of the name has gone\n\nInto my being, and each pleasant scene\n\nIs growing fresh before me as the green\n\nOf our own vallies: so I will begin\n\nNow while I cannot hear the city?s din;\n        40\n\nNow while the early budders are just new,\n\nAnd run in mazes of the youngest hue\n\nAbout old forests; while the willow trails\n\nIts delicate amber; and the dairy pails\n\nBring home increase of milk. And, as the year\n        45\n\nGrows lush in juicy stalks, I?ll smoothly steer\n\nMy little boat, for many quiet hours,\n\nWith streams that deepen freshly into bowers.\n\nMany and many a verse I hope to write,\n\nBefore the daisies, vermeil rimm?d and white,\n        50\n\nHide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees\n\nHum about globes of clover and sweet peas,\n\nI must be near the middle of my story.\n\nO may no wintry season, bare and hoary,\n\nSee it half finished: but let Autumn bold,\n        55\n\nWith universal tinge of sober gold,\n\nBe all about me when I make an end.\n\nAnd now at once, adventuresome, I send\n\nMy herald thought into a wilderness:\n\nThere let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress\n        60\n\nMy uncertain path with green, that I may speed\n\nEasily onward, thorough flowers and weed.\n\n \n\n  Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread\n\nA mighty forest; for the moist earth fed\n\nSo plenteously all weed-hidden roots\n        65\n\nInto o?er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.\n\nAnd it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,\n\nWhere no man went; and if from shepherd?s keep\n\nA lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,\n\nNever again saw he the happy pens\n        70\n\nWhither his brethren, bleating with content,\n\nOver the hills at every nightfall went.\n\nAmong the shepherds, ?twas believed ever,\n\nThat not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever\n\nFrom the white flock, but pass?d unworried\n        75\n\nBy angry wolf, or pard with prying head,\n\nUntil it came to some unfooted plains\n\nWhere fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains\n\nWho thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,\n\nWinding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,\n        80\n\nAnd ivy banks; all leading pleasantly\n\nTo a wide lawn, whence one could only see\n\nStems thronging all around between the swell\n\nOf turf and slanting branches: who could tell\n\nThe freshness of the space of heaven above,\n        85\n\nEdg?d round with dark tree tops? through which a dove\n\nWould often beat its wings, and often too\n\nA little cloud would move across the blue.\n\n \n\n  Full in the middle of this pleasantness\n\nThere stood a marble altar, with a tress\n        90\n\nOf flowers budded newly; and the dew\n\nHad taken fairy phantasies to strew\n\nDaisies upon the sacred sward last eve,\n\nAnd so the dawned light in pomp receive.\n\nFor ?twas the morn: Apollo?s upward fire\n        95\n\nMade every eastern cloud a silvery pyre\n\nOf brightness so unsullied, that therein\n\nA melancholy spirit well might win\n\nOblivion, and melt out his essence fine\n\nInto the winds: rain-scented eglantine\n        100\n\nGave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;\n\nThe lark was lost in him; cold springs had run\n\nTo warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;\n\nMan?s voice was on the mountains; and the mass\n\nOf nature?s lives and wonders puls?d tenfold,\n        105\n\nTo feel this sun-rise and its glories old.\n\n \n\n  Now while the silent workings of the dawn\n\nWere busiest, into that self-same lawn\n\nAll suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped\n\nA troop of little children garlanded;\n        110\n\nWho gathering round the altar, seemed to pry\n\nEarnestly round as wishing to espy\n\nSome folk of holiday: nor had they waited\n\nFor many moments, ere their ears were sated\n\nWith a faint breath of music, which ev?n then\n        115\n\nFill?d out its voice, and died away again.\n\nWithin a little space again it gave\n\nIts airy swellings, with a gentle wave,\n\nTo light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking\n\nThrough copse-clad vallies,?ere their death, oer-taking\n        120\n\nThe surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.\n\n \n\n  And now, as deep into the wood as we\n\nMight mark a lynx?s eye, there glimmered light\n\nFair faces and a rush of garments white,\n\nPlainer and plainer shewing, till at last\n        125\n\nInto the widest alley they all past,\n\nMaking directly for the woodland altar.\n\nO kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter\n\nIn telling of this goodly company,\n\nOf their old piety, and of their glee:\n        130\n\nBut let a portion of ethereal dew\n\nFall on my head, and presently unmew\n\nMy soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,\n\nTo stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.\n\n \n\n  Leading the way, young damsels danced along,\n        135\n\nBearing the burden of a shepherd song;\n\nEach having a white wicker over brimm?d\n\nWith April?s tender younglings: next, well trimm?d,\n\nA crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks\n\nAs may be read of in Arcadian books;\n        140\n\nSuch as sat listening round Apollo?s pipe,\n\nWhen the great deity, for earth too ripe,\n\nLet his divinity o?er-flowing die\n\nIn music, through the vales of Thessaly:\n\nSome idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,\n        145\n\nAnd some kept up a shrilly mellow sound\n\nWith ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,\n\nNow coming from beneath the forest trees,\n\nA venerable priest full soberly,\n\nBegirt with ministring looks: alway his eye\n        150\n\nStedfast upon the matted turf he kept,\n\nAnd after him his sacred vestments swept.\n\nFrom his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,\n\nOf mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;\n\nAnd in his left he held a basket full\n        155\n\nOf all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:\n\nWild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still\n\nThan Leda?s love, and cresses from the rill.\n\nHis aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,\n\nSeem?d like a poll of ivy in the teeth\n        160\n\nOf winter hoar. Then came another crowd\n\nOf shepherds, lifting in due time aloud\n\nTheir share of the ditty. After them appear?d,\n\nUp-followed by a multitude that rear?d\n\nTheir voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,\n        165\n\nEasily rolling so as scarce to mar\n\nThe freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:\n\nWho stood therein did seem of great renown\n\nAmong the throng. His youth was fully blown,\n\nShewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;\n        170\n\nAnd, for those simple times, his garments were\n\nA chieftain king?s: beneath his breast, half bare,\n\nWas hung a silver bugle, and between\n\nHis nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.\n\nA smile was on his countenance; he seem?d,\n        175\n\nTo common lookers on, like one who dream?d\n\nOf idleness in groves Elysian:\n\nBut there were some who feelingly could scan\n\nA lurking trouble in his nether lip,\n\nAnd see that oftentimes the reins would slip\n        180\n\nThrough his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,\n\nAnd think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,\n\nOf logs piled solemnly.?Ah, well-a-day,\n\nWhy should our young Endymion pine away!\n\n \n\n  Soon the assembly, in a circle rang?d,\n        185\n\nStood silent round the shrine: each look was chang?d\n\nTo sudden veneration: women meek\n\nBeckon?d their sons to silence; while each cheek\n\nOf virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.\n\nEndymion too, without a forest peer,\n        190\n\nStood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,\n\nAmong his brothers of the mountain chase.\n\nIn midst of all, the venerable priest\n\nEyed them with joy from greatest to the least,\n\nAnd, after lifting up his aged hands,\n        195\n\nThus spake he: ?Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!\n\nWhose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:\n\nWhether descended from beneath the rocks\n\nThat overtop your mountains; whether come\n\nFrom vallies where the pipe is never dumb;\n        200\n\nOr from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs\n\nBlue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze\n\nBuds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge\n\nNibble their fill at ocean?s very marge,\n\nWhose mellow reeds are touch?d with sounds forlorn\n        205\n\nBy the dim echoes of old Triton?s horn:\n\nMothers and wives! who day by day prepare\n\nThe scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;\n\nAnd all ye gentle girls who foster up\n\nUdderless lambs, and in a little cup\n        210\n\nWill put choice honey for a favoured youth:\n\nYea, every one attend! for in good truth\n\nOur vows are wanting to our great god Pan.\n\nAre not our lowing heifers sleeker than\n\nNight-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains\n        215\n\nSpeckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains\n\nGreen?d over April?s lap? No howling sad\n\nSickens our fearful ewes; and we have had\n\nGreat bounty from Endymion our lord.\n\nThe earth is glad: the merry lark has pour?d\n        220\n\nHis early song against yon breezy sky,\n\nThat spreads so clear o?er our solemnity.?\n\n \n\n  Thus ending, on the shrine he heap?d a spire\n\nOf teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;\n\nAnon he stain?d the thick and spongy sod\n        225\n\nWith wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.\n\nNow while the earth was drinking it, and while\n\nBay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,\n\nAnd gummy frankincense was sparkling bright\n\n?Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light\n        230\n\nSpread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:\n\n \n\n  ?O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang\n\nFrom jagged trunks, and overshadoweth\n\nEternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death\n\nOf unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;\n        235\n\nWho lov?st to see the hamadryads dress\n\nTheir ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;\n\nAnd through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken\n\nThe dreary melody of bedded reeds?\n\nIn desolate places, where dank moisture breeds\n        240\n\nThe pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;\n\nBethinking thee, how melancholy loth\n\nThou wast to lose fair Syrinx?do thou now,\n\nBy thy love?s milky brow!\n\nBy all the trembling mazes that she ran,\n        245\n\nHear us, great Pan!\n\n \n\n  ?O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles\n\nPassion their voices cooingly ?mong myrtles,\n\nWhat time thou wanderest at eventide\n\nThrough sunny meadows, that outskirt the side\n        250\n\nOf thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom\n\nBroad leaved fig trees even now foredoom\n\nTheir ripen?d fruitage; yellow girted bees\n\nTheir golden honeycombs; our village leas\n\nTheir fairest-blossom?d beans and poppied corn;\n        255\n\nThe chuckling linnet its five young unborn,\n\nTo sing for thee; low creeping strawberries\n\nTheir summer coolness; pent up butterflies\n\nTheir freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year\n\nAll its completions?be quickly near,\n        260\n\nBy every wind that nods the mountain pine,\n\nO forester divine!\n\n \n\n  ?Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies\n\nFor willing service; whether to surprise\n\nThe squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;\n        265\n\nOr upward ragged precipices flit\n\nTo save poor lambkins from the eagle?s maw;\n\nOr by mysterious enticement draw\n\nBewildered shepherds to their path again;\n\nOr to tread breathless round the frothy main,\n        270\n\nAnd gather up all fancifullest shells\n\nFor thee to tumble into Naiads? cells,\n\nAnd, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;\n\nOr to delight thee with fantastic leaping,\n\nThe while they pelt each other on the crown\n        275\n\nWith silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown?\n\nBy all the echoes that about thee ring,\n\nHear us, O satyr king!\n\n \n\n  ?O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,\n\nWhile ever and anon to his shorn peers\n        280\n\nA ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,\n\nWhen snouted wild-boars routing tender corn\n\nAnger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,\n\nTo keep off mildews, and all weather harms:\n\nStrange ministrant of undescribed sounds,\n        285\n\nThat come a swooning over hollow grounds,\n\nAnd wither drearily on barren moors:\n\nDread opener of the mysterious doors\n\nLeading to universal knowledge?see,\n\nGreat son of Dryope,\n        290\n\nThe many that are come to pay their vows\n\nWith leaves about their brows!\n\n \n\n  Be still the unimaginable lodge\n\nFor solitary thinkings; such as dodge\n\nConception to the very bourne of heaven,\n        295\n\nThen leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,\n\nThat spreading in this dull and clodded earth\n\nGives it a touch ethereal?a new birth:\n\nBe still a symbol of immensity;\n\nA firmament reflected in a sea;\n        300\n\nAn element filling the space between;\n\nAn unknown?but no more: we humbly screen\n\nWith uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,\n\nAnd giving out a shout most heaven rending,\n\nConjure thee to receive our humble Paean,\n        305\n\nUpon thy Mount Lycean!\n\n \n\n  Even while they brought the burden to a close,\n\nA shout from the whole multitude arose,\n\nThat lingered in the air like dying rolls\n\nOf abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals\n        310\n\nOf dolphins bob their noses through the brine.\n\nMeantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,\n\nYoung companies nimbly began dancing\n\nTo the swift treble pipe, and humming string.\n\nAye, those fair living forms swam heavenly\n        315\n\nTo tunes forgotten?out of memory:\n\nFair creatures! whose young children?s children bred\n\nThermopylæ its heroes?not yet dead,\n\nBut in old marbles ever beautiful.\n\nHigh genitors, unconscious did they cull\n        320\n\nTime?s sweet first-fruits?they danc?d to weariness,\n\nAnd then in quiet circles did they press\n\nThe hillock turf, and caught the latter end\n\nOf some strange history, potent to send\n\nA young mind from its bodily tenement.\n        325\n\nOr they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent\n\nOn either side; pitying the sad death\n\nOf Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath\n\nOf Zephyr slew him,?Zephyr penitent,\n\nWho now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,\n        330\n\nFondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.\n\nThe archers too, upon a wider plain,\n\nBeside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,\n\nAnd the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft\n\nBranch down sweeping from a tall ash top,\n        335\n\nCall?d up a thousand thoughts to envelope\n\nThose who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee\n\nAnd frantic gape of lonely Niobe,\n\nPoor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young\n\nWere dead and gone, and her caressing tongue\n        340\n\nLay a lost thing upon her paly lip,\n\nAnd very, very deadliness did nip\n\nHer motherly cheeks. Arous?d from this sad mood\n\nBy one, who at a distance loud halloo?d,\n\nUplifting his strong bow into the air,\n        345\n\nMany might after brighter visions stare:\n\nAfter the Argonauts, in blind amaze\n\nTossing about on Neptune?s restless ways,\n\nUntil, from the horizon?s vaulted side,\n\nThere shot a golden splendour far and wide,\n        350\n\nSpangling those million poutings of the brine\n\nWith quivering ore: ?twas even an awful shine\n\nFrom the exaltation of Apollo?s bow;\n\nA heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.\n\nWho thus were ripe for high contemplating,\n        355\n\nMight turn their steps towards the sober ring\n\nWhere sat Endymion and the aged priest\n\n?Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas?d\n\nThe silvery setting of their mortal star.\n\nThere they discours?d upon the fragile bar\n        360\n\nThat keeps us from our homes ethereal;\n\nAnd what our duties there: to nightly call\n\nVesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;\n\nTo summon all the downiest clouds together\n\nFor the sun?s purple couch; to emulate\n        365\n\nIn ministring the potent rule of fate\n\nWith speed of fire-tailed exhalations;\n\nTo tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons\n\nSweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,\n\nA world of other unguess?d offices.\n        370\n\nAnon they wander?d, by divine converse,\n\nInto Elysium; vieing to rehearse\n\nEach one his own anticipated bliss.\n\nOne felt heart-certain that he could not miss\n\nHis quick gone love, among fair blossom?d boughs,\n        375\n\nWhere every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows\n\nHer lips with music for the welcoming.\n\nAnother wish?d, mid that eternal spring,\n\nTo meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,\n\nSweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:\n        380\n\nWho, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,\n\nAnd with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;\n\nAnd, ever after, through those regions be\n\nHis messenger, his little Mercury.\n\nSome were athirst in soul to see again\n        385\n\nTheir fellow huntsmen o?er the wide champaign\n\nIn times long past; to sit with them, and talk\n\nOf all the chances in their earthly walk;\n\nComparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores\n\nOf happiness, to when upon the moors,\n        390\n\nBenighted, close they huddled from the cold,\n\nAnd shar?d their famish?d scrips. Thus all out-told\n\nTheir fond imaginations,?saving him\n\nWhose eyelids curtain?d up their jewels dim,\n\nEndymion: yet hourly had he striven\n        395\n\nTo hide the cankering venom, that had riven\n\nHis fainting recollections. Now indeed\n\nHis senses had swoon?d off: he did not heed\n\nThe sudden silence, or the whispers low,\n\nOr the old eyes dissolving at his woe,\n        400\n\nOr anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,\n\nOr maiden?s sigh, that grief itself embalms:\n\nBut in the self-same fixed trance he kept,\n\nLike one who on the earth had never stept.\n\nAye, even as dead-still as a marble man,\n        405\n\nFrozen in that old tale Arabian.\n\n \n\n  Who whispers him so pantingly and close?\n\nPeona, his sweet sister: of all those,\n\nHis friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,\n\nAnd breath?d a sister?s sorrow to persuade\n        410\n\nA yielding up, a cradling on her care.\n\nHer eloquence did breathe away the curse:\n\nShe led him, like some midnight spirit nurse\n\nOf happy changes in emphatic dreams,\n\nAlong a path between two little streams,?\n        415\n\nGuarding his forehead, with her round elbow,\n\nFrom low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow\n\nFrom stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;\n\nUntil they came to where these streamlets fall,\n\nWith mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,\n        420\n\nInto a river, clear, brimful, and flush\n\nWith crystal mocking of the trees and sky.\n\nA little shallop, floating there hard by,\n\nPointed its beak over the fringed bank;\n\nAnd soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,\n        425\n\nAnd dipt again, with the young couple?s weight,?\n\nPeona guiding, through the water straight,\n\nTowards a bowery island opposite;\n\nWhich gaining presently, she steered light\n\nInto a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,\n        430\n\nWhere nested was an arbour, overwove\n\nBy many a summer?s silent fingering;\n\nTo whose cool bosom she was used to bring\n\nHer playmates, with their needle broidery,\n\nAnd minstrel memories of times gone by.\n        435\n\n \n\n  So she was gently glad to see him laid\n\nUnder her favourite bower?s quiet shade,\n\nOn her own couch, new made of flower leaves,\n\nDried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves\n\nWhen last the sun his autumn tresses shook,\n        440\n\nAnd the tann?d harvesters rich armfuls took.\n\nSoon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:\n\nBut, ere it crept upon him, he had prest\n\nPeona?s busy hand against his lips,\n\nAnd still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips\n        445\n\nIn tender pressure. And as a willow keeps\n\nA patient watch over the stream that creeps\n\nWindingly by it, so the quiet maid\n\nHeld her in peace: so that a whispering blade\n\nOf grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling\n        450\n\nDown in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling\n\nAmong seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.\n\n \n\n  O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,\n\nThat broodest o?er the troubled sea of the mind\n\nTill it is hush?d and smooth! O unconfin?d\n        455\n\nRestraint! imprisoned liberty! great key\n\nTo golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,\n\nFountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,\n\nEchoing grottos, full of tumbling waves\n\nAnd moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world\n        460\n\nOf silvery enchantment!?who, upfurl?d\n\nBeneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,\n\nBut renovates and lives??Thus, in the bower,\n\nEndymion was calm?d to life again.\n\nOpening his eyelids with a healthier brain,\n        465\n\nHe said: ?I feel this thine endearing love\n\nAll through my bosom: thou art as a dove\n\nTrembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings\n\nAbout me; and the pearliest dew not brings\n\nSuch morning incense from the fields of May,\n        470\n\nAs do those brighter drops that twinkling stray\n\nFrom those kind eyes,?the very home and haunt\n\nOf sisterly affection. Can I want\n\nAught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?\n\nYet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears\n        475\n\nThat, any longer, I will pass my days\n\nAlone and sad. No, I will once more raise\n\nMy voice upon the mountain-heights; once more\n\nMake my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:\n\nAgain my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll\n        480\n\nAround the breathed boar: again I?ll poll\n\nThe fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:\n\nAnd, when the pleasant sun is getting low,\n\nAgain I?ll linger in a sloping mead\n\nTo hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed\n        485\n\nOur idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,\n\nAnd, if thy lute is here, softly intreat\n\nMy soul to keep in its resolved course.?\n\n \n\n  Hereat Peona, in their silver source,\n\nShut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,\n        490\n\nAnd took a lute, from which there pulsing came\n\nA lively prelude, fashioning the way\n\nIn which her voice should wander. ?Twas a lay\n\nMore subtle cadenced, more forest wild\n\nThan Dryope?s lone lulling of her child;\n        495\n\nAnd nothing since has floated in the air\n\nSo mournful strange. Surely some influence rare\n\nWent, spiritual, through the damsel?s hand;\n\nFor still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann?d\n\nThe quick invisible strings, even though she saw\n        500\n\nEndymion?s spirit melt away and thaw\n\nBefore the deep intoxication.\n\nBut soon she came, with sudden burst, upon\n\nHer self-possession?swung the lute aside,\n\nAnd earnestly said: ?Brother, ?tis vain to hide\n        505\n\nThat thou dost know of things mysterious,\n\nImmortal, starry; such alone could thus\n\nWeigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn?d in aught\n\nOffensive to the heavenly powers? Caught\n\nA Paphian dove upon a message sent?\n        510\n\nThy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,\n\nSacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen\n\nHer naked limbs among the alders green;\n\nAnd that, alas! is death. No, I can trace\n\nSomething more high perplexing in thy face!?\n        515\n\n \n\n  Endymion look?d at her, and press?d her hand,\n\nAnd said, ?Art thou so pale, who wast so bland\n\nAnd merry in our meadows? How is this?\n\nTell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!?\n\nAh! thou hast been unhappy at the change\n        520\n\nWrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?\n\nOr more complete to overwhelm surmise?\n\nAmbition is no sluggard: ?tis no prize,\n\nThat toiling years would put within my grasp,\n\nThat I have sigh?d for: with so deadly gasp\n        525\n\nNo man e?er panted for a mortal love.\n\nSo all have set my heavier grief above\n\nThese things which happen. Rightly have they done:\n\nI, who still saw the horizontal sun\n\nHeave his broad shoulder o?er the edge of the world,\n        530\n\nOut-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl?d\n\nMy spear aloft, as signal for the chace?\n\nI, who, for very sport of heart, would race\n\nWith my own steed from Araby; pluck down\n\nA vulture from his towery perching; frown\n        535\n\nA lion into growling, loth retire?\n\nTo lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,\n\nAnd sink thus low! but I will ease my breast\n\nOf secret grief, here in this bowery nest.\n\n \n\n  ?This river does not see the naked sky,\n        540\n\nTill it begins to progress silverly\n\nAround the western border of the wood,\n\nWhence, from a certain spot, its winding flood\n\nSeems at the distance like a crescent moon:\n\nAnd in that nook, the very pride of June,\n        545\n\nHad I been used to pass my weary eves;\n\nThe rather for the sun unwilling leaves\n\nSo dear a picture of his sovereign power,\n\nAnd I could witness his most kingly hour,\n\nWhen he doth lighten up the golden reins,\n        550\n\nAnd paces leisurely down amber plains\n\nHis snorting four. Now when his chariot last\n\nIts beams against the zodiac-lion cast,\n\nThere blossom?d suddenly a magic bed\n\nOf sacred ditamy, and poppies red:\n        555\n\nAt which I wondered greatly, knowing well\n\nThat but one night had wrought this flowery spell;\n\nAnd, sitting down close by, began to muse\n\nWhat it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,\n\nIn passing here, his owlet pinions shook;\n        560\n\nOr, it may be, ere matron Night uptook\n\nHer ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,\n\nHad dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth\n\nCame not by common growth. Thus on I thought,\n\nUntil my head was dizzy and distraught.\n        565\n\nMoreover, through the dancing poppies stole\n\nA breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;\n\nAnd shaping visions all about my sight\n\nOf colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;\n\nThe which became more strange, and strange, and dim,\n        570\n\nAnd then were gulph?d in a tumultuous swim:\n\nAnd then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell\n\nThe enchantment that afterwards befel?\n\nYet it was but a dream: yet such a dream\n\nThat never tongue, although it overteem\n        575\n\nWith mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,\n\nCould figure out and to conception bring\n\nAll I beheld and felt. Methought I lay\n\nWatching the zenith, where the milky way\n\nAmong the stars in virgin splendour pours;\n        580\n\nAnd travelling my eye, until the doors\n\nOf heaven appear?d to open for my flight,\n\nI became loth and fearful to alight\n\nFrom such high soaring by a downward glance:\n\nSo kept me stedfast in that airy trance,\n        585\n\nSpreading imaginary pinions wide.\n\nWhen, presently, the stars began to glide,\n\nAnd faint away, before my eager view:\n\nAt which I sigh?d that I could not pursue,\n\nAnd dropt my vision to the horizon?s verge;\n        590\n\nAnd lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge\n\nThe loveliest moon, that ever silver?d o?er\n\nA shell for Neptune?s goblet: she did soar\n\nSo passionately bright, my dazzled soul\n\nCommingling with her argent spheres did roll\n        595\n\nThrough clear and cloudy, even when she went\n\nAt last into a dark and vapoury tent?\n\nWhereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train\n\nOf planets all were in the blue again.\n\nTo commune with those orbs, once more I rais?d\n        600\n\nMy sight right upward: but it was quite dazed\n\nBy a bright something, sailing down apace,\n\nMaking me quickly veil my eyes and face:\n\nAgain I look?d, and, O ye deities,\n\nWho from Olympus watch our destinies!\n        605\n\nWhence that completed form of all completeness?\n\nWhence came that high perfection of all sweetness?\n\nSpeak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where\n\nHast thou a symbol of her golden hair?\n\nNot oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;\n        610\n\nNot?thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun\n\nSuch follying before thee?yet she had,\n\nIndeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;\n\nAnd they were simply gordian?d up and braided,\n\nLeaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,\n        615\n\nHer pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;\n\nThe which were blended in, I know not how,\n\nWith such a paradise of lips and eyes,\n\nBlush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,\n\nThat, when I think thereon, my spirit clings\n        620\n\nAnd plays about its fancy, till the stings\n\nOf human neighbourhood envenom all.\n\nUnto what awful power shall I call?\n\nTo what high fane??Ah! see her hovering feet,\n\nMore bluely vein?d, more soft, more whitely sweet\n        625\n\nThan those of sea-born Venus, when she rose\n\nFrom out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows\n\nHer scarf into a fluttering pavilion;\n\n?Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million\n\nOf little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,\n        630\n\nOver the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,\n\nHandfuls of daisies.???Endymion, how strange!\n\nDream within dream!???She took an airy range,\n\nAnd then, towards me, like a very maid,\n\nCame blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,\n        635\n\nAnd press?d me by the hand: Ah! ?twas too much;\n\nMethought I fainted at the charmed touch,\n\nYet held my recollection, even as one\n\nWho dives three fathoms where the waters run\n\nGurgling in beds of coral: for anon,\n        640\n\nI felt upmounted in that region\n\nWhere falling stars dart their artillery forth,\n\nAnd eagles struggle with the buffeting north\n\nThat balances the heavy meteor-stone;?\n\nFelt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,\n        645\n\nBut lapp?d and lull?d along the dangerous sky.\n\nSoon, as it seem?d, we left our journeying high,\n\nAnd straightway into frightful eddies swoop?d;\n\nSuch as ay muster where grey time has scoop?d\n\nHuge dens and caverns in a mountain?s side:\n        650\n\nThere hollow sounds arous?d me, and I sigh?d\n\nTo faint once more by looking on my bliss?\n\nI was distracted; madly did I kiss\n\nThe wooing arms which held me, and did give\n\nMy eyes at once to death: but ?twas to live,\n        655\n\nTo take in draughts of life from the gold fount\n\nOf kind and passionate looks; to count, and count\n\nThe moments, by some greedy help that seem?d\n\nA second self, that each might be redeem?d\n\nAnd plunder?d of its load of blessedness.\n        660\n\nAh, desperate mortal! I ev?n dar?d to press\n\nHer very cheek against my crowned lip,\n\nAnd, at that moment, felt my body dip\n\nInto a warmer air: a moment more,\n\nOur feet were soft in flowers. There was store\n        665\n\nOf newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes\n\nA scent of violets, and blossoming limes,\n\nLoiter?d around us; then of honey cells,\n\nMade delicate from all white-flower bells;\n\nAnd once, above the edges of our nest,\n        670\n\nAn arch face peep?d,?an Oread as I guess?d.\n\n \n\n  ?Why did I dream that sleep o?er-power?d me\n\nIn midst of all this heaven? Why not see,\n\nFar off, the shadows of his pinions dark,\n\nAnd stare them from me? But no, like a spark\n        675\n\nThat needs must die, although its little beam\n\nReflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream\n\nFell into nothing?into stupid sleep.\n\nAnd so it was, until a gentle creep,\n\nA careful moving caught my waking ears,\n        680\n\nAnd up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,\n\nMy clenched hands;?for lo! the poppies hung\n\nDew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung\n\nA heavy ditty, and the sullen day\n\nHad chidden herald Hesperus away,\n        685\n\nWith leaden looks: the solitary breeze\n\nBluster?d, and slept, and its wild self did teaze\n\nWith wayward melancholy; and r thought,\n\nMark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought\n\nFaint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!?\n        690\n\nAway I wander?d?all the pleasant hues\n\nOf heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades\n\nWere deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades\n\nWere full of pestilent light; our taintless rills\n\nSeem?d sooty, and o?er-spread with upturn?d gills\n        695\n\nOf dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown\n\nIn frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown\n\nLike spiked aloe. If an innocent bird\n\nBefore my heedless footsteps stirr?d, and stirr?d\n\nIn little journeys, I beheld in it\n        700\n\nA disguis?d demon, missioned to knit\n\nMy soul with under darkness; to entice\n\nMy stumblings down some monstrous precipice:\n\nTherefore I eager followed, and did curse\n\nThe disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,\n        705\n\nRock?d me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!\n\nThese things, with all their comfortings, are given\n\nTo my down-sunken hours, and with thee,\n\nSweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea\n\nOf weary life.?\n\n                  Thus ended he, and both\n        710\n\nSat silent: for the maid was very loth\n\nTo answer; feeling well that breathed words\n\nWould all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords\n\nAgainst the enchased crocodile, or leaps\n\nOf grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,\n        715\n\nAnd wonders; struggles to devise some blame;\n\nTo put on such a look as would say, Shame\n\nOn this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,\n\nShe could as soon have crush?d away the life\n\nFrom a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,\n        720\n\nShe said with trembling chance: ?Is this the cause?\n\nThis all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!\n\nThat one who through this middle earth should pass\n\nMost like a sojourning demi-god, and leave\n\nHis name upon the harp-string, should achieve\n        725\n\nNo higher bard than simple maidenhood,\n\nSinging alone, and fearfully,?how the blood\n\nLeft his young cheek; and how he used to stray\n\nHe knew not where; and how he would say, nay,\n\nIf any said ?twas love: and yet ?twas love;\n        730\n\nWhat could it be but love? How a ring-dove\n\nLet fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;\n\nAnd how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,\n\nThe gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;\n\nAnd then the ballad of his sad life closes\n        735\n\nWith sighs, and an alas!?Endymion!\n\nBe rather in the trumpet?s mouth,?anon\n\nAmong the winds at large?that all may hearken!\n\nAlthough, before the crystal heavens darken,\n\nI watch and dote upon the silver lakes\n        740\n\nPictur?d in western cloudiness, that takes\n\nThe semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,\n\nIslands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands\n\nWith horses prancing o?er them, palaces\n\nAnd towers of amethyst,?would I so tease\n        745\n\nMy pleasant days, because I could not mount\n\nInto those regions? The Morphean fount\n\nOf that fine element that visions, dreams,\n\nAnd fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams\n\nInto its airy channels with so subtle,\n        750\n\nSo thin a breathing, not the spider?s shuttle,\n\nCircled a million times within the space\n\nOf a swallow?s nest-door, could delay a trace,\n\nA tinting of its quality: how light\n\nMust dreams themselves be; seeing they?re more slight\n        755\n\nThan the mere nothing that engenders them!\n\nThen wherefore sully the entrusted gem\n\nOf high and noble life with thoughts so sick?\n\nWhy pierce high-fronted honour to the quick\n\nFor nothing but a dream?? Hereat the youth\n        760\n\nLook?d up: a conflicting of shame and ruth\n\nWas in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids\n\nWidened a little, as when Zephyr bids\n\nA little breeze to creep between the fans\n\nOf careless butterflies: amid his pains\n        765\n\nHe seem?d to taste a drop of manna-dew,\n\nFull palatable; and a colour grew\n\nUpon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.\n\n \n\n  ?Peona! ever have I long?d to slake\n\nMy thirst for the world?s praises: nothing base,\n        770\n\nNo merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace\n\nThe stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar?d?\n\nThough now ?tis tatter?d; leaving my bark bar?d\n\nAnd sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope\n\nIs of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,\n        775\n\nTo fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.\n\nWherein lies happiness? In that which becks\n\nOur ready minds to fellowship divine,\n\nA fellowship with essence; till we shine,\n\nFull alchemiz?d, and free of space. Behold\n        780\n\nThe clear religion of heaven! Fold\n\nA rose leaf round thy finger?s taperness,\n\nAnd soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress\n\nOf music?s kiss impregnates the free winds,\n\nAnd with a sympathetic touch unbinds\n        785\n\nEolian magic from their lucid wombs:\n\nThen old songs waken from enclouded tombs;\n\nOld ditties sigh above their father?s grave;\n\nGhosts of melodious prophecyings rave\n\nRound every spot where trod Apollo?s foot;\n        790\n\nBronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,\n\nWhere long ago a giant battle was;\n\nAnd, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass\n\nIn every place where infant Orpheus slept.\n\nFeel we these things??that moment have we stept\n        795\n\nInto a sort of oneness, and our state\n\nIs like a floating spirit?s. But there are\n\nRicher entanglements, enthralments far\n\nMore self-destroying, leading, by degrees,\n\nTo the chief intensity: the crown of these\n        800\n\nIs made of love and friendship, and sits high\n\nUpon the forehead of humanity.\n\nAll its more ponderous and bulky worth\n\nIs friendship, whence there ever issues forth\n\nA steady splendour; but at the tip-top,\n        805\n\nThere hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop\n\nOf light, and that is love: its influence,\n\nThrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,\n\nAt which we start and fret; till in the end,\n\nMelting into its radiance, we blend,\n        810\n\nMingle, and so become a part of it,?\n\nNor with aught else can our souls interknit\n\nSo wingedly: when we combine therewith,\n\nLife?s self is nourish?d by its proper pith,\n\nAnd we are nurtured like a pelican brood.\n        815\n\nAye, so delicious is the unsating food,\n\nThat men, who might have tower?d in the van\n\nOf all the congregated world, to fan\n\nAnd winnow from the coming step of time\n\nAll chaff of custom, wipe away all slime\n        820\n\nLeft by men-slugs and human serpentry,\n\nHave been content to let occasion die,\n\nWhilst they did sleep in love?s elysium.\n\nAnd, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,\n\nThan speak against this ardent listlessness:\n        825\n\nFor I have ever thought that it might bless\n\nThe world with benefits unknowingly;\n\nAs does the nightingale, upperched high,\n\nAnd cloister?d among cool and bunched leaves?\n\nShe sings but to her love, nor e?er conceives\n        830\n\nHow tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.\n\nJust so may love, although ?tis understood\n\nThe mere commingling of passionate breath,\n\nProduce more than our searching witnesseth:\n\nWhat I know not: but who, of men, can tell\n        835\n\nThat flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell\n\nTo melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,\n\nThe earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,\n\nThe meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,\n\nThe seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,\n        840\n\nTones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,\n\nIf human souls did never kiss and greet?\n\n \n\n  ?Now, if this earthly love has power to make\n\nMen?s being mortal, immortal; to shake\n\nAmbition from their memories, and brim\n        845\n\nTheir measure of content; what merest whim,\n\nSeems all this poor endeavour after fame,\n\nTo one, who keeps within his stedfast aim\n\nA love immortal, an immortal too.\n\nLook not so wilder?d; for these things are true,\n        850\n\nAnd never can be born of atomies\n\nThat buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,\n\nLeaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I?m sure,\n\nMy restless spirit never could endure\n\nTo brood so long upon one luxury,\n        855\n\nUnless it did, though fearfully, espy\n\nA hope beyond the shadow of a dream.\n\nMy sayings will the less obscured seem,\n\nWhen I have told thee how my waking sight\n\nHas made me scruple whether that same night\n        860\n\nWas pass?d in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!\n\nBeyond the matron-temple of Latona,\n\nWhich we should see but for these darkening boughs,\n\nLies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows\n\nBushes and trees do lean all round athwart,\n        865\n\nAnd meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,\n\nAnd spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide\n\nPast them, but he must brush on every side.\n\nSome moulder?d steps lead into this cool cell,\n\nFar as the slabbed margin of a well,\n        870\n\nWhose patient level peeps its crystal eye\n\nRight upward, through the bushes, to the sky.\n\nOft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set\n\nLike vestal primroses, but dark velvet\n\nEdges them round, and they have golden pits:\n        875\n\n?Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits\n\nIn a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,\n\nWhen all above was faint with mid-day heat.\n\nAnd there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,\n\nI?d bubble up the water through a reed;\n        880\n\nSo reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships\n\nOf moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,\n\nWith leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be\n\nOf their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,\n\nWhen love-lorn hours had left me less a child,\n        885\n\nI sat contemplating the figures wild\n\nOf o?er-head clouds melting the mirror through.\n\nUpon a day, while thus I watch?d, by flew\n\nA cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;\n\nSo plainly character?d, no breeze would shiver\n        890\n\nThe happy chance: so happy, I was fain\n\nTo follow it upon the open plain,\n\nAnd, therefore, was just going; when, behold!\n\nA wonder, fair as any I have told?\n\nThe same bright face I tasted in my sleep,\n        895\n\nSmiling in the clear well. My heart did leap\n\nThrough the cool depth.?It moved as if to flee?\n\nI started up, when lo! refreshfully,\n\nThere came upon my face, in plenteous showers,\n\nDew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,\n        900\n\nWrapping all objects from my smothered sight,\n\nBathing my spirit in a new delight.\n\nAye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss\n\nAlone preserved me from the drear abyss\n\nOf death, for the fair form had gone again.\n        905\n\nPleasure is oft a visitant; but pain\n\nClings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth\n\nOn the deer?s tender haunches: late, and loth,\n\n?Tis scar?d away by slow returning pleasure.\n\nHow sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure\n        910\n\nOf weary days, made deeper exquisite,\n\nBy a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!\n\nLike sorrow came upon me, heavier still,\n\nThan when I wander?d from the poppy hill:\n\nAnd a whole age of lingering moments crept\n        915\n\nSluggishly by, ere more contentment swept\n\nAway at once the deadly yellow spleen.\n\nYes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;\n\nOnce more been tortured with renewed life.\n\nWhen last the wintry gusts gave over strife\n        920\n\nWith the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies\n\nWarm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes\n\nIn pity of the shatter?d infant buds,?\n\nThat time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,\n\nMy hunting cap, because I laugh?d and smil?d,\n        925\n\nChatted with thee, and many days exil?d\n\nAll torment from my breast;??twas even then,\n\nStraying about, yet, coop?d up in the den\n\nOf helpless discontent,?hurling my lance\n\nFrom place to place, and following at chance,\n        930\n\nAt last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,\n\nAnd, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck\n\nIn the middle of a brook,?whose silver ramble\n\nDown twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,\n\nTracing along, it brought me to a cave,\n        935\n\nWhence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave\n\nThe nether sides of mossy stones and rock,?\n\n?Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock\n\nIts own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,\n\nHung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread\n        940\n\nThick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph?s home.\n\n?Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam??\n\nSaid I, low voic?d: ?Ah whither! ?Tis the grot\n\nOf Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,\n\nDoth her resign; and where her tender hands\n        945\n\nShe dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:\n\nOr ?tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,\n\nAnd babbles thorough silence, till her wits\n\nAre gone in tender madness, and anon,\n\nFaints into sleep, with many a dying tone\n        950\n\nOf sadness. O that she would take my vows,\n\nAnd breathe them sighingly among the boughs,\n\nTo sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,\n\nDaily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,\n\nAnd weave them dyingly?send honey-whispers\n        955\n\nRound every leaf, that all those gentle lispers\n\nMay sigh my love unto her pitying!\n\nO charitable echo! hear, and sing\n\nThis ditty to her!?tell her??so I stay?d\n\nMy foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,\n        960\n\nStood stupefied with my own empty folly,\n\nAnd blushing for the freaks of melancholy.\n\nSalt tears were coming, when I heard my name\n\nMost fondly lipp?d, and then these accents came:\n\n?Endymion! the cave is secreter\n        965\n\nThan the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir\n\nNo sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise\n\nOf thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys\n\nAnd trembles through my labyrinthine hair.?\n\nAt that oppress?d I hurried in.?Ah! where\n        970\n\nAre those swift moments? Whither are they fled?\n\nI?ll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed\n\nSorrow the way to death, but patiently\n\nBear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;\n\nAnd come instead demurest meditation,\n        975\n\nTo occupy me wholly, and to fashion\n\nMy pilgrimage for the world?s dusky brink.\n\nNo more will I count over, link by link,\n\nMy chain of grief: no longer strive to find\n\nA half-forgetfulness in mountain wind\n        980\n\nBlustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,\n\nDearest of sisters, what my life shall be;\n\nWhat a calm round of hours shall make my days.\n\nThere is a paly flame of hope that plays\n\nWhere?er I look: but yet, I?ll say ?tis naught?\n        985\n\nAnd here I bid it die. Have not I caught,\n\nAlready, a more healthy countenance?\n\nBy this the sun is setting; we may chance\n\nMeet some of our near-dwellers with my car.?\n\n \n\n  This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star\n        990\n\nThrough autumn mists, and took Peona?s hand:\n\nThey stept into the boat, and launch?d from land.\n\n \n\n\n \n',NULL),(87,4,'f16e9ac2d35a9b9a:502d56:fe1180b5dc:-8000','2004-07-30 15:21:22',0,'',NULL),(88,4,'f16e9ac2d35a9b9a:502d56:fe1180b5dc:-7fff','2004-07-30 15:40:46',0,'',NULL),(89,2,'f16e9ac2d35a9b9a:502d56:fe1180b5dc:-7ffe','2004-07-30 15:45:32',1439,'i',NULL),(92,1,'2d9067a76949ffba:c625e1:fe1a55edf8:-8000','2004-08-01 08:32:11',9719,'\n      Shortly after the trial Hector died, never having spoken since the disappearance of Mme. Andryot.  Sylvie buried him in the front garden, marking the little grave with a small crucifix.  The miniature memorial is still clearly visible from the window where Absinthe continued to survey her world, inside and out, for many years after these troublesome human events.  Sylvie married Foulard, who brought a miracle of reconciliation to the house and inheritance that now came into Sylvie?s sole possession.   Heloise, Sylvie, and Foulard lived together in seclusion from that time forward, and their intercourse with the rest of the town ceased.  Merchants making deliveries of food and other necessities spread scandalous reports about that trinity of strange souls.  Absinthe died peacefully in 1848 at the age of 21 years.  Town gossip about the house and its inhabitants gradually fell off, but decades later, in 1909, it erupted again when the merchants suddenly ceased to receive their regular orders in those now familiar little missives with the inverted trident seal.

Philip Gabriel  \n  Hi, how are you?  This morning 1 went to a zoo in the neighborhood to see the kangaroos. Itfs not a very big zoo, but somehow theyfve managed to gather together most every kind of animal&mdashEverything from gorillas to elephants. But if what youfre afterfs a llama or an anteater, then youfd better not go there. There arenft any llamas or anteaters. No impalas or hyenas either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, theyfve got four kangaroos.  One is a baby, born just two months ago. And therefs one male and two females. I have no idea what kind of family organization they have.  Every time I look at a kangaroo I always find it strange to think of what itfd be like to be one of them. What are they jumping all around a silly place like Australia for? And why are they killed by such an awkward sort of stick as a boomerang?  I really donft know.  But, well&mdashit doesnft really matter. Itfs no big deal.   At any rate, while I was watching the kangaroos I found myself wanting to send you a letter.  You might think this a little weird. gWhy did you want to send me a letter after watching kangaroos? What do kangaroos have to do with me?h youfll ask. But please donft worry about that. It doesnft matter. Kangaroos are kangaroos and you are you.  What I mean is this.  There are 36 subtle steps between the kangaroos and you, and when I followed them one by one in the correct order, I arrived at where you are. Thatfs all there is to it. Even if I tried to explain all of these steps to you one at a time, I donft think youfd understand and besides I donft even remember them.  eCause therefre 36 of them!  If the order of any one of them had gotten messed up, I wouldnft have been sending you this letter. Instead I might have all of a sudden decided to jump on the back of a sperm whale in the Arctic Ocean. Or I might have set fire to the neighborhood tobacco shop.  Guided by this stack of 36 coincidences, though, here I am sending you a letter.  Itfs all very strange.   O.K., let me begin by introducing myself.   Ifm 26, and work in the merchandise control section of a department store. This is&mdashas I think you can easily imagine&mdasha terribly boring job. First, we check the merchandise purchased by the stock department to see if therefre any defects. We do this to make sure no cozy relationship builds up between that department and the wholesalers, but itfs all done kind of half-heartedly. We sit around shooting the breeze, pulling at shoe buckles, or taking bites out of cakes, just things like that. This is what they mean by merchandise control.  And one more job, actually our main one, is to answer complaints we get from customers about our merchandise. For instance, two pairs of new stockings both got runs in them, or a wind-up toy bear fell off a table and wonft work anymore, or a bathrobe shrank by a quarter in the washing machine. Those type of complaints.  Well, you might not be aware of it, but the number of these complaints is depressingly large. Therefre so many that four employees, running around all day, canft keep up with them. Some complaints seem justified, and some are outrageous. And some are hard to place in either group.  For conveniencefs sake we divide them into three ranks, A, B, and C. In the middle of the room are three large boxes labelled A, B, and C, and we throw the letters into them. We call it the eThree-Step Critique of Reason.h Of course this is an in-joke at the office. Please donft let it bother you.  Anyway, the three ranks are as follows:  A. Reasonable complaints. Cases in which our company must take responsibility. We take a gift box of sweets to the customerfs house, and exchange the merchandise for something appropriate.  B. Cases in which our company is not to blame, either morally, legally, or according to standard business practice. In order not to damage the stores reputation, and to avoid any unnecessary trouble, however, we take the appropriate action.  C. Cases in which it is clearly the customer at fault. We explain the situation and request that they withdraw their complaint.   Now, concerning your complaint we received the other day, after careful examination, we ye arrived at the conclusion that itfs the type that should be ranked C. The reason why is&mdashall right? Please listen carefully&mdash  1. The record that you bought 2. especially after a week has passed 3. without a receipt, cannot be exchanged. No matter where you went in the world you couldnft exchange it. Do you understand what Ifm saying?   This ends my official explanation.  Your complaint has been rejected.  However, if one distances oneself from the official position-something Ifm always doing-my personal reaction to your complaint-that you mistakenly bought Brahms instead of Mahler-is one of sincere sympathy. This isnft a lie. And that is precisely why instead of a perfunctory office memo, Ifm sending you this kind of, in a certain sense, intimate message.  To tell you the truth, all week Ifve tried over and over to write you a letter.  Ifm very sorry, but according to standard business practices, we canft exchange your record. But something in your letter touched me, and personally, blab blab blab.... That kind of letter. But I never could write it well. Itfs not that Ifm poor at writing, itfs just that when I decided to write, the words wouldnft come. The words that did come were not to the point. Itfs a strange thing.  So I decided not to reply. If Ifm going to send you an incomplete letter, itfd be better not to send anything. Donft you think so? I do. An imperfect message is like a mixed-up train schedule.  But this morning, in front of the kangaroofs fence, I experienced the accumulation of 36 coincidences and had a revelation. What this was, in other words, was an enormous incompleteness.  What, you might ask, is an enormous incompleteness?-and well you might ask. An enormous incompleteness, well, to put it simply, might be something like someone in effect ending up forgiving someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, and you forgive me-this kind of thing, for example.  Hmmm.  This kind of cycle, however, is not permanent; someday the kangaroo might not want to forgive you. But donft get angry at the kangaroo just because of this. Itfs not the kangaroofs fault or your own. And itfs not my fault. The kangaroo, too, has very complicated reasons for this. Who could ever criticize a kangaroo?  To grab hold of the instant is all we are able to do. To grab hold of the instant and take a souvenir photograph. In the front row from the left, you, the kangaroo, and me.  I gave up trying to write it down. No matter what I did it wouldnft come out right. For instance, if I write the word gcoincidence,h what you feel from the shape of this written word might be completely different-or even the opposite-of what I feel from the same shape. I think this is very unfair. Ifve stripped to my undershorts, but youfve only undone three buttons of your blouse. Itfs really unfair.  So I bought a cassette tape, and decided to record the letter to you directly.  (Whistling. Eight bars of gThe Colonel Bogey March.h)   Howfs that? Can you hear me?  I donft know how youfll feel when you receive this letter-I mean tape. I canft even imagine. Maybe youfll feel very uneasy about it. Because-because in response to a letter of complaint from a customer the head of merchandise control records his reply on a cassette-and itfs a personal message-and sends it, a highly irregular, and depending on your viewpoint, really stupid thing to do. If it does make you uneasy, and you send this tape back to my boss, itfd put me in a terribly delicate position at the office.  If youfd like to do so, please go ahead.  If that happened, I wouldnft be angry or hate you. You see, wefre on a 1000/0 equal footing. That is, I have the right to send you a letter, and you have the right to put my means of making a living in jeopardy.  Thatfs right, isnft it.  We are equal. Please just remember that.   Oh, right, I forgot to tell you something. Ifve named this letter the gKangaroo Communique.h  Everything needs a name.  Letfs say youfre keeping a diary. Instead of writing something long like gToday an answer to my complaint came from the chief of merchandise control at the department store,h you can just write gToday the eKangaroo Communiquef came.h And itfs a wonderful name, donft you think? From far across the broad plain, a kangaroo with mail in its pouch comes hopping your way.  Rap rap rap. (The sound of a table being hit.)  This is a knock.  Knock knock knock... do you see?  If you donft want to open the door, you donft have to. Either way is all right. If you donft want to listen anymore, please stop the tape and throw it in the garbage can. I just want to sit outside your door and talk by myself for a little while, thatfs all. I have no idea whether youfre listening to me or not. If I have no idea, then it doesnft really matter whether you listen or not, does it? Ha ha ha.   OK&mdashanyhow letfs do it.  Incompleteness, though, is quite troublesome. I didnft think talking in front of a mike like this without any script or plan would be so hard. I feel just like I was standing in the middle of a desert sprinkling water around with a cup. Therefs nothing to see and no response.  So Ifve started talking toward the needle on the VU meter. You know what a VU meter is, donft you? Itfs that thing with the needle that shakes and oscillates according to the volume. I donft know what the V and the U stand for. But even so, they are the only presences that show a response to my speech.  Well...  By the way, they have a simple set of values.  In other words, V and U.  This V and U are like, well, a comedy team. If not V, then U, if not U, then V. What a wonderful world. It makes no difference to them what I talk about. All theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air tremble. Thatfs all. For them, because the air is trembling, I exist.  Isnft that great?  When I look at them, I feel like saying anything, just to keep on talking.  Sigh...  That reminds me. The other day I saw a really sad movie. It was about a comedian that no one laughed at, no matter how many jokes he told.  You understand? Not a single person laughed.  Talking in front of this mike like I am now, I suddenly If remembered that movie.  Itfs a strange thing.  The same lines spoken by one person are screamingly funny, but spoken by someone else are not funny at all. Strange, isnft it? I thought about it, and felt that maybe the difference is somehow inborn. I mean, you know, the tips of their semi-circular canals are curved a little more than other people, something like that.  Sometimes I think about how happy Ifd be to have that ability. Things I always find funny that have me rolling on the floor, once I tell them to others are not a bit interesting and are surprisingly boring. I feel like Ifve become the Sandman of Egypt. And first of all...  Do you know about the Sandman of Egypt?  You see, uhc the Sandman of Egypt was born the prince of Egypt. A long time ago, the age when there were the pyramids and the sphinx and all. But since he had such an ugly face-a really terribly ugly face-the king shunned him and abandoned him deep in the jungle. And what happened next was he was raised by wolves or apes. Not so unusual. And then for some reason he becomes the Sandman. Whatever the Sandman touches changes into sand. Breezes change to sandstorms, brooks become streams of sand, and plains turn into deserts. Thatfs the story of the Sandman. Heard of it? You havenft, right? Thatfs because I made it up. Ha ha ha.  Anyhow, talking to you this way makes me feel like this become the Sandman. Everything I touch turns to sand, sand, sand, sand, sand, sand.   cSomehow Ifve talked too much about myself But if you think about it, it canft be helped. eCause I donft know anything about you. All I know about you is your name and address, thatfs it. I have no idea how old you are, how much you make a year, what shape your nose is, whether youfre fat or thin, married or not. But those are not important. It might even be better that I donft know. I want to handle everything simply, as simply as possible, in a word, metaphysically.  What I mean is, I have your letter here.  Thatfs enough for me.  Just like a zoologist who can calculate from droppings hefs collected in the jungle an elephantfs diet, behavioral patterns, weight, and sex life, based on one letter I can feel the existence of a person&mdashyou. Of course facial features, brand of perfume, etc., those kind of useless things are left out. Existence-itself.  Your letter was really quite captivating. The style, handwriting, punctuation, paragraphing, rhetoric-everything was flawless. Not outstanding. Just flawless.  Every month I read over 500 letters, but honestly this is the first time Ifve ever read one so moving. I snuck your letter home, and read it over and over. Then I analyzed it thoroughly. Since it was a short letter, this wasnft much trouble.  I found out a lot through analyzing it. First of all, the overwhelming number of commas. For every period there were 6.36 commas. A lot, donft you think? Thatfs not all. The way the commas were used really went against all rules.  Please donft think Ifm making fun of your writing. Because I am simply moved.  Moved.  Not just by the punctuation. All the elements of your letter&mdasheven the single ink stain&mdasharoused and shook me.  Why?  Because, in the final analysis, in those sentences you are nowhere to be found. Of course therefs a story. A girl&mdashor a woman&mdashbought the wrong record. Though she had the feeling that the wrong pieces were on it, it was a week before she realized shefd bought the wrong record. The sales clerk wouldnft exchange it for her. So she wrote a letter of complaint. This is the story.  I had to read your letter three times before I understood that story. Because your letter was completely different from the other letters sent to us. To put it plainly, therefs not even a complaint in your letter. No emotion either. The only thing that is present is&mdashthe story.  To tell you the truth, I was a little worried. I couldnft figure out if your letter was meant to be a complaint, a confession, a declaration, or whether it was the establishment of a kind of thesis. Your letter made me think of a news photograph of a massacre. No caption, no article, just a photograph. A photograph taken in some nameless country beside some unknown road, of corpses strewn about.  I canft even figure out what it is you want. Your letter is like the jumbled complexity of a makeshift ant hill, giving no clue as to where to begin. A marvelous thing.  Bang bang bangc a massacre.  Thatfs right, letfs simplify things further. Make them very very simple.  What I mean is, your letter uplifts me sexually.  Thatfs what I mean.   Ifd like to talk about sex.  Knock knock knock.  A knock.  If you arenft interested, please stop the tape. Ifll talk to the VU meter by myself. Blab blab blab.  OK?   The front legs are short and have five toes, while the remarkably large hind legs have four. Just the fourth toe is fully developed. The second and third toes are quite small and are fused.  ... This is a description of a kangaroofs feet. Ha ha ha.  Well then, about sex.   Ever since I took your letter home, all Ifve been thinking about is sleeping with you. In bed with you beside me, when I wake up in the morning youfre still there. When I wake up youfre already up and I can hear the sound of a dress being zipped. But Il... hey, do you know therefs nothing that breaks as easily as the zipper on a dress?c I keep my eyes closed and pretend to be asleep. I canft see you. And you walk across the room and disappear into the bathroom. Then finally I open my eyes. I eat and go to work.  The night is pitch black-Ifve put up special blinds on the window to make it that way-and of course I canft see your face. I donft know your age or weight, or anything. So I canft touch your body with my hand.  But, wellc thatfs all right.  To tell the truth, itfs all right whether I have sex with you or not.  cNo, it isnft.  Let me think for a minute.   OK&mdashthis is what I mean. I want to sleep with you. But itfs OK if we donft. What I mean is I want to be in as fair a position as possible. I donft want to force people to do anything or have them force me. Itfs enough to feel your presence beside me, to have your punctuation marks running around and around me.  Do you understand me?  What I mean is this.  Sometimes itfs very trying for me to think about the individual. A soon as I do my body feels like itfs about to be broken into pieces.  Take, for instance, when Ifm riding on a train. Therefre several dozen people riding on the train. In principle these are merely gpassengers.h gPassengersh carried from Aoyama Itchome to Akasaka Mitsuke. But sometimes I get to feeling very uneasy about the presence of each passenger. What could this person be, what could that person be, why is he riding on the Ginza Line? And then itfs too much. Once I start to feel uneasy therefs no end to it. That office workerfs starting to go bald on both sides of his forehead, isnft he... the hair on that girlfs shins is a little thick, wonder if she shaves once a weekc why is that young guy sitting over there wearing that tie whose color clashes?clike that. And finally my body starts trembling all over and I want to leap from the train. The other day&mdashyoufll probably laugh&mdashI was on the verge of pushing the emergency brake button beside the door.  But just because Ifve told you this, donft get the idea that I am particularly sensitive or nervous. I am not overly sensitive or nervous. Ifm a very ordinary, everyday office worker, the kind you see everyday, who works in the merchandise control section of a department store. And I like the subways.  And itfs not that I have any sexual problems either. I have a girlfriend, and since about a year ago wefve been sleeping together twice a week, an arrangement we re both pretty satisfied with. But Ifve been trying very hard not to think too deeply about her. I donft feel like marrying, either. If we got married, Ifm sure Ifd start to think deeply about her, and I have absolutely no confidence wefd be able to get along once that started. Thatfs the way it is, isnft it? If you worry about the way the teeth of the girl youfre living with are aligned, or the shape of her nails, it wonft work out.   Please let me talk a little more about myself.  This time without any knocks.  If youfve listened this far, please listen all the way to the end.  Just a moment. Ifm going to have a cigarette.  (Rustle rustle)  ...Up till now Ifve hardly ever said a thing about myself to anyone. eCause therefs nothing much to talk about. Even if I did, probably no one would be interested.  So why am 1 talking to you this way?  Itfs because, like I said before, right now I am aiming at an enormous incompleteness.  What was it that touched off this huge incompleteness?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Kangaroos.  Kangaroos are fascinating animals, and I never get tired of looking at them, no matter how many hours I watch. What are they thinking about? They jump meaninglessly round their enclosure all day, and occasionally dig holes in the ground. And what do they do with these holes theyfve dug? Nothing. They just dig holes. Ha ha ha.  A kangaroo gives birth to just one baby at a time. So a female kangaroo gets pregnant as soon as shefs given birth. If it werenft that way they couldnft maintain their numbers. A female kangaroo, then, spends nearly her whole life in pregnancy and raising young. If she isnft pregnant, shefs raising them, if not raising them, then pregnant. So you can say that kangaroos exist to make kangaroos continue to exist. Without the existence of kangaroos, they wouldnft continue to exist, and without the goal of continuing the existence of kangaroos, kangaroos themselves wouldnft exist.  Itfs a strange thing, isnft it.   Ifm sorry the order of what Ifve said has gotten all mixed up.  Ifll talk about myself.  Actually, Ifm extremely frustrated by having to be myself. Not by my looks or ability or position. Just by my being myself. I feel itfs extremely unfair.  Now please donft get the idea from this that I am a very frustrated person. Ifve never once complained about my job or salary. Sure, my job is pointless, but so arc most jobs. And moneyfs not a big problem.  Let me be more precise.  I want to be in two places at once. This is my one and only desire. Besides this I have no other desires.  But this separate entity known as me gets in the way of this desire. Donft you think this is a very unhappy fact? This desire of mine is a modest one, I think. Itfs not that I want to be the leader of the world or an artistic genius. Or to fly through the air. I just want to exist in two places at once. Not three or four, you understand, just two. While listening to an orchestra in a concert hall, I want to roller-skate. While being the head of a department storefs merchandise control, I want to also be a McDonaldfs Quarter Pounder. While sleeping with my girlfriend, I want to be sleeping with you. While being an individual, I also want to be a universal.   Let me have another cigarette.  Sigh...  Ifm a little tired.  Ifm not used to this, talking so honestly about myself.  One thing I want to affirm: I donft have any sexual desire towards you, a woman. As I said before, I am very angry at the fact that I can only be myself. Being a single individual makes me terribly unhappy. I canft stand odd numbers. So I donft want to sleep with you as you the individual.   How wonderful itfd be if you could be split in two, and I could be split in two, and those four people could share a bed. Donft you agree?   Please donft send a reply. If you want to send me a letter, send a letter or complaint in care of the company. If you donft have any complaint to make, think of something.  Well, thatfs all.   I just played the tape back up to this point. To tell you the truth, Ifm not satisfied with it at all. I feel like the guy in charge of feeding animals at the aquarium who lets a sea lion die by mistake. I worried quite a lot about whether this tapefs something I should send to you or not.  Even now that Ifve decided to send it, Ifm still worried.  At any rate, Ifve been aspiring to incompleteness, so I guess I should go along with it without any qualms. What supports it all are you and the four kangaroos.   Well, thatfs all. \n     geovisit();    ',NULL),(425,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:dd5681:fe2f6806b0:-8000','2004-08-05 10:44:00',1,'The Kangaroo Communiqué By MURAKAMI Haruki Translated by Alfred Birnbaum\n The Kangaroo Communiqué By MURAKAMI Haruki Translated by Alfred Birnbaum\n Say hey, how\'s tricks?  This morning I paid a call on the kangaroos at the local zoo. Not your biggest zoo, but itfs got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, don\'t go out of your way. You won\'t find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I can\'t for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I can\'t figure it out.  Though, really, that\'s neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind. Kangaroos are kangaroos, you are you.  In other words, itfs like this.  Thirty-six intricate procedural steps, followed one by one in just the right order, led me from the kangaroos to you--that\'s it. To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldn\'t be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe Ifd have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isn\'t it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job--as I\'m sure you can easily imagine--is terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there aren\'t any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually itfs a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, that\'s about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine--those kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints--the sheer number--is enough to dampen anyonefs spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, wefve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office wefve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call gTri-level Rationality Evaluation.h In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customersf homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customerfs fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were--ready? listen carefully!--we cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet I\'m saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside--and actually I leave it aside a lot--my personal reaction to your plight--having mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms--is one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And itfs not although I\'m no good at writing letters. Itfs just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least that\'s what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask--who wouldn\'t ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me--to cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please don\'t get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. Itfs not the kangaroosf fault and itfs not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. That\'s all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. Itfs going nowhere. Say I write the word gcoincidenceh. What you read in the word gcoincidenceh could be utterly different--even opposite--from what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while youfve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.  (Whistling--eight bars of Colonel Bogie\'s March)  Testing, can you hear me?  I don\'t really know how you will take to receiving this letter--that is, this tape--I really can\'t imagine. I suppose you might even get quite upset by it all. Why?c because itfs highly unusual for a product control clerk of a department store to reply to a customer complaint by cassette tape--with a personalized message, too, mind you!--you could even, if you were so inclined, say the whole thing was downright bizarre. And say, were you to get so upset that you sent this tape back to my boss, my standing within the organization would be placed in a terribly delicate balance indeed.  But if that is what you want to do please do so.  If it comes to that, I will not get mad or hold grudge against you.  Clear enough? We are on 100% equal term: I have the right to send you a letter and you have the right to threaten my livelihood.  Isn\'t that right?  Wefre even-steven. Just remember that.  Come to think of it, I forgot to mention that I\'m calling this letter The Kangaroo Communiqué.  I mean, everything needs a name, right?  Suppose, for instance, you keep a diary. Instead of writing this tong, drawn out entry. gDepartment store product control clerkfs reply re. complaint arrives,h you could simply write Kangaroo Communiqué arrivesh and be done with it. And such a catchy name, too, don\'t you think? The Kangaroo Communiqué: makes you think of kangaroos bounding off across the vast plains, pouches stuffed full of mail. Doesn\'t it?  Thump, thump, thump (rapping on tabletop).  Now for some knocking.  Knock, knockc Stop me if youfve heard this.  Don\'t open the door if you don\'t feel like it. Either way is perfectly fine. If you don\'t want to listen any more, please stop the tape and throw it away. I just wanted to sit down a while by your front door talking to myself, that\'s all. I have no idea whatsoever if youfre listening or not, but since I don\'t know, it\'s really all the same whether you do or you don\'t, isn\'t it? Ha, ha, ha.  Okay, what the hell, letfs give it a go.  Still and all, this imperfection business is pretty tough going. Whofd have thought talking into a microphone without any script or plan would be so hard? Itfs like standing in the middle of the desert sprinkling water around with a cup. No visible sign of anything, not one thing to cling to.  That\'s why all this time Ifve been talking to the VU meters. You know, the VU meters? Those gizmos with the needles that twitch to the volume. I don\'t know what the V or the U stand for, but whatever, theyfre the only thing showing any reaction to my ranting.  Hey hey.  All the same, their criteria are really quite simple.  V and U, well, theyfre like a vaudeville duo. Therefs no V without U and no U without V--a nice little set up. As far as theyfre concerned it really doesn\'t matter what I babble on about. The only thing theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air vibrate. To them, the air vibrates therefore I am.  Pretty swift, don\'t you think?  Watching them, I get to thinking it doesn\'t matter what I say so long as I keep talking.  Whoah!  Come to think of it, not too long ago I saw a movie. It was about a comedian who just couldn\'t make anyone laugh no matter what jokes he told. Got the picture? Not one soul would laugh.  Well, talking into this microphone, I\'m reminded of that movie over and over again.  Itfs all very odd.  Lines spoken by one person will have you dying with laughter, but the very same lines spoken by another won\'t seem funny in the least. Curious, don\'t you think? And the more I think about it, that difference just seems to be one of these things youfre born with. See, itfs like the curvature of the semicircular canals of your cars having the edge over somebody elsefs, or... you know.  Sometimes I find myself thinking, if only I had such gifts, how happy Ifd be. I\'m always doubling over laughing to myself when something funny strikes me, but try to tell someone else and it falls flat, a dud. It makes me feel like the Egyptian Sandman. Even more, itfs...  You know about the Egyptian Sandman?  Hmm, well you see, the Egyptian Sandman was Prince of Egypt by birth. A long time ago, back in the days of pyramids and sphinxes and all that. But because he was so ugly--I mean truly ugly--the King had him sent off into the deepest jungle to get rid of him. Well, it so happens that the kid ends up getting raised by wolves, or monkeys maybe. One of those stories, you know. And somehow or other he becomes a Sandman. Now this sandman, everything he touches turns to sand. Breezes turn into sandstorm, babbling brooks turn to sand drifts, grassy plains turn to desert. So goes the tale of the Sandman. Ever hear it before? Probably not, eh? That\'s because I just made it up. Ha, ha, ha.  Anyway, talking to you like this, I get the feeling Ifve become the Egyptian Sandman myself. And what I touch. Itfs sand, sand, sandc  ...Once again. I see I\'m talking about myself too much. But all things considered, itfs unavoidable. I mean, I don\'t even know one solitary thing about you. Ifve got your address and your name, and that\'s it. Your age, income bracket, the shape of your nose, whether youfre slender or overweight, married or not--what do I know? Not that any of that really matters. Itfs almost better this way. If at all possible I prefer to keep things simple, very simple, on the metaphysical level if you will.  To wit, here I have your letter.  This is all I need.  Just as the zoologist collects shit samples in the jungle from which to deduce the elephantfs dietary habits and patterns of activity and weight and sex life, so your one latter gives me enough to go on. I can actually sense what makes up your person. Of course, minus your looks, the kind of perfume you wear, details like that. Nonetheless--your very essence.  Your letter was honestly quite fascinating. Your choice of words, the handwriting, punctuation, spacing between lines, rhetoric, everything was perfect. Superlative, it was not. But perfect, yes.  Every month I read over five hundred letters, and frankly yours was the first letter that ever moved me. I secretly took your letter home with me and read it over and over again. Then I analyzed your letter thoroughly. Being such a short letter, it was no trouble at all.  Many things came to light through my analysis. First of all, the number of punctuation marks is overwhelming. 6.36 commas for every period. On the high side, don\'t you think? And that\'s not all: the way you punctuate is markedly irregular.  Listen, please don\'t think I\'m putting down your writing. I\'m simply moved by it.  Enthralled.  And itfs not just the commas either. Every part of your letter--down to each ink smear--everything set me off, everything shook me.  Why?  Well the long and the short of it is, therefs no you in the whole piece of writing. Oh, therefs a story to it alright. A girl--aman--makes a mistake buying a record. She had the feeling the record had the wrong tunes, but still she went ahead and bought it, and itfs exactly one week before she realizes. The sales girl won\'t exchange it. So she writes a letter of complaint. That\'s the story.  I had to reread your letter three times before I grasped the story. The reason was, your letter was completely different from all the other letters of complaint that come our way. To put it bluntly, there wasn\'t even any complaint in your letter. Let alone any emotion. The only thing that was there--was the story.  Really and truly, you had me wondering. Was the letter in fact intended as a complaint or a confession or a proclamation, or was it perhaps meant to put forth some thesis? I had no idea. Your letter reminded me of a news photo from the scene of a massacre. With no commentary, no article, no nothing--just a photo. A shot of dead bodies littered along some roadside in some country somewhere.  Bang bang bang... therefs your massacre.  No wait, we carn simplify things a little. Simplify them a lot.  That is to say, your letter excites me sexually.  There you have it.   Let us now address the topic of sex.  Thud, thud, thud.  More knocking.  You know, if this doesn\'t interest you, you can stop the tape. I\'m just talking to myself, blabbering away to the VU meters. Blah, blah, blah.  Okay?   Picture this; short forearms with five fingers, but singularly huge hind legs with four toes, the fourth of which is immensely overdeveloped, while the second and third are extra tiny and fused togetherc that\'s a description of the feet of a kangaroo. Ha ha ha.  Uh, moving on the topic of sex.  Ever since I took your letter home with me, all I can seem to think about is sleeping with you. That I\'ll climb into bed to find you next to me, wake up in the morning and there youfd be. As I open my eyes youfll already be getting out of bed, and I\'ll hear you zipping up your dress. There Ifd be--and you know how delicate a zipper on a dress can be--well, Ifd just shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep. I wouldn\'t even set eye on you.  Once you cut across the room and disappear into the washroom, only then would I open my eyes. Then Ifd get a bite to eat and head out to work.  In the pitch black of night--I\'ll install special blinds on my windows to make the place extra pitch black--of course I wouldn\'t see your face. Ifd know nothing, not your age or weight. So I wouldn\'t lay a hand on you either.  But, well, that\'s fine.  If you realty want to know, it makes no difference whatsoever if I have sex with you or not.  No. I take that back.  Let me think that one over.   Okay, letfs put it this way. I would like to sleep with you. But itfs alright if I don\'t sleep with you. What I\'m saying is Ifd like to be as fair as possible. I don\'t want to force anything on anybody, any more than Ifd want anything forced on me. Itfs enough that I feel your presence or see your commas swirling around me.  You see, itfs like this.  Sometimes when I think about entities--like in gseparate entitiesh--it gets mighty grim. I start thinking, and I nearly go to pieces.  cFor instance, say youfre riding on the subway. And there are dozens of people in the car. Mere gpassengersh youfd have to call them, as a rule. gPassengersh being conveyed from Aoyama 1-chome to Akasakamitsuke. Sometimes, though, itfll strike you, that each and every one of those passengers is a distinct individual entity. Like, what does this one do? Or why on earth do you suppose that onefs riding the Ginza Line? Or whatever. By then itfs too late. You let it get to you and youfre a goner.  Looks like that businessmanfs hairline is receding, or the girl over therefs got such hairy legs I bet she shaves at least once a week, or why is that young guy sitting across the aisle wearing that awful color tie? Little things like that. Until finally youfve got the shakes and you want to jump out of the car then and there. Why just the other day--I know youfre going to laugh, but--I was on the verge of pressing the emergency brake button by the door.  I admit it. But that doesn\'t mean you should go thinking I\'m hypersensitive or on edge all the time. I\'m really a regular sort of guy, your everyday ordinary work-a-day type, gainfully employed in the product control section of a department store. And Ifve got nothing against the subway.  Nor do I have any problem sexually. There\'s a woman I\'m seeing--I guess you could call her my girlfriend--been sleeping with her twice a week for maybe a year now. And she and I, wefre both pretty satisfied. Only I try not to take her too seriously. I have no intention of marrying her. If I thought about getting married, I\'m sure Ifd begin taking her seriously, and Ifd lose all confidence that I could carry on from that point. I mean that\'s how it is. You live with a girl and these things start to get to you--her teeth aren\'t exactly straight, the shape of her fingernails--how can you expect to go on like that?   Let me say a little more about myself.  No knocking this time.  If youfve listened this far, you might as well hear me out.  Just a second. I need a smoke.  Rattle, rattle.  cUp to now Ifve hardly said a word about myself. Like, therefs really not that much to say. And even if I did, probably nobody would find it terribly interesting.  So why am I telling you all this?  I think I already told you, itfs because now my sights are set on the Nobility of Imperfection.  And what touched off this Nobility of Imperfection idea?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Yes, kangaroos.  Kangaroos are such fascinating creatures, I can look at them for hours on end. What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and that\'s it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If shefs not pregnant, shefs nursing babies, if shefs not nursing babies, shefs pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldn\'t survive if there weren\'t any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasn\'t to go on existing, kangaroos wouldn\'t be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But I\'m getting ahead of myself. Excuse me.  To talk about myself, then.  Actually, I\'m extremely dissatisfied with being who I am. Itfs nothing to do with my looks or abilities or status or any of that. It simply has to do with being me. The situation strikes me as grossly unfair.  Still, that doesn\'t mean you should write me off as someone with a lot of gripes. I have not one complaint about the place where I work or my salary. The work is undeniably boring, but then most jobs are boring. Money it not a major issue here.  Shall I put it on the line?  I want to be able to be in two places at once. That is my one and only wish. Other than that, therefs not a thing I desire.  Yet being who and what I am, my singularity hampers this desire of mine. An unhappy lot, don\'t you think? My wish, if anything, is rather unassuming. I don\'t want to be ruler of the world, nor do I want to be an artist of genius. I merely want to exist in two places simultaneously. Got itf Not three, not four, only two. I want to be roller skating while I\'m listening to an orchestra at a concert hall. I want to be a MacDonaldfs Quarter-Pounder and still be a clerk in the product control section of the department store. I want to sleep with you and be sleeping with my girlfriend all the while. I went to lead a general existence and yet be a distinct, separate entity.  Allow me one more cigarette.  Whoah.  Getting a little tired.  I\'m not used to this, speaking so frankly about myself.  Therefs just one thing Ifd like to get clear, though. Which is that do not lust after you sexually as a woman. Like I told you, I am angry at the fact that I am only myself and nothing else. This being a solitary entity is dreadfully depressing. Hence I do not seek to sleep with you, a solitary individual.  If, however, you were to divide in two, and I split into two as well, and we four all shared the same bed together, wouldn\'t that be something! Don\'t you think?  Please send no reply. If you decide you want to write sue a letter, please send it ease of the company in the form of a complaint. If not a complaint, then whatever you come up with.  That\'s about it.   I listened to the tape this far on playback just now. To be honest, I\'m very dissatisfied with it. I feel like an aquarium trainer whofs let a seal die out of negligence. It made me worry whether I should even send you this tape or not, blowing this thing all out of proportion even by my standards.  And now that Ifve decided to send it, I\'m still worried.  But what the hell, I\'m striving for imperfection. So Ifve got to live happily by my choice. It was you and the four kangaroos who got me into this imperfection after all.  Signing off.Say hey, howfs tricks?  This morning I paid a call on the kangaroos at the local zoo. Not your biggest zoo, but itfs got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, donft go out of your way. You wonft find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I canft for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I canft figure it out.  Though, really, thatfs neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind. Kangaroos are kangaroos, you are you.  In other words, itfs like this.  Thirty-six intricate procedural steps, followed one by one in just the right order, led me from the kangaroos to you&mdashthatfs it. To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldnft be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe Ifd have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isnft it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job&mdashas Ifm sure you can easily imagine&mdashis terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there arenft any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually itfs a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, thatfs about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine&mdashthose kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints&mdashthe sheer number&mdashis enough to dampen anyonefs spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, wefve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office wefve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call gTri-level Rationality Evaluation.h In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customersf homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customerfs fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were&mdashready? listen carefully!&mdashwe cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet Ifm saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside&mdashand actually I leave it aside a lot&mdashmy personal reaction to your plight&mdashhaving mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms&mdashis one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And itfs not although Ifm no good at writing letters. Itfs just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least thatfs what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask&mdashwho wouldnft ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me&mdashto cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please donft get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. Itfs not the kangaroosf fault and itfs not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. Thatfs all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. Itfs going nowhere. Say I write the word gcoincidenceh. What you read in the word gcoincidenceh could be utterly different&mdasheven opposite&mdashfrom what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while youfve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.  (Whistling&mdasheight bars of Colonel Bogiefs March)  Testing, can you hear me?  I donft really know how you will take to receiving this letter&mdashthat is, this tape&mdashI really canft imagine. I suppose you might even get quite upset by it all. Why?c because itfs highly unusual for a product control clerk of a department store to reply to a customer complaint by cassette tape&mdashwith a personalized message, too, mind you!&mdashyou could even, if you were so inclined, say the whole thing was downright bizarre. And say, were you to get so upset that you sent this tape back to my boss, my standing within the organization would be placed in a terribly delicate balance indeed.  But if that is what you want to do please do so.  If it comes to that, I will not get mad or hold grudge against you.  Clear enough? We are on 100% equal term: I have the right to send you a letter and you have the right to threaten my livelihood.  Isnft that right?  Wefre even-steven. Just remember that.  Come to think of it, I forgot to mention that Ifm calling this letter The Kangaroo Communiqué.  I mean, everything needs a name, right?  Suppose, for instance, you keep a diary. Instead of writing this tong, drawn out entry. gDepartment store product control clerkfs reply re. complaint arrives,h you could simply write gKangaroo Communiqué arrivesh and be done with it. And such a catchy name, too, donft you think? The Kangaroo Communiqué: makes you think of kangaroos bounding off across the vast plains, pouches stuffed full of mail. Doesnft it?  Thump, thump, thump (rapping on tabletop).  Now for some knocking.  Knock, knockc Stop me if youfve heard this.  Donft open the door if you donft feel like it. Either way is perfectly fine. If you donft want to listen any more, please stop the tape and throw it away. I just wanted to sit down a while by your front door talking to myself, thatfs all. I have no idea whatsoever if youfre listening or not, but since I donft know, itfs really all the same whether you do or you donft, isnft it? Ha, ha, ha.  Okay, what the hell, letfs give it a go.  Still and all, this imperfection business is pretty tough going. Whofd have thought talking into a microphone without any script or plan would be so hard? Itfs like standing in the middle of the desert sprinkling water around with a cup. No visible sign of anything, not one thing to cling to.  Thatfs why all this time Ifve been talking to the VU meters. You know, the VU meters? Those gizmos with the needles that twitch to the volume.

What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and thatfs it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If shefs not pregnant, shefs nursing babies, if shefs not nursing babies, shefs pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldnft survive if there werenft any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasnft to go on existing, kangaroos wouldnft be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But Ifm getting ahead of myself.

Not your biggest zoo, but itfs got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, don\'t go out of your way. You won\'t find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I can\'t for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I can\'t figure it out.  Though, really, that\'s neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind. Kangaroos are kangaroos, you are you.  In other words, itfs like this.  Thirty-six intricate procedural steps, followed one by one in just the right order, led me from the kangaroos to you--that\'s it. To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldn\'t be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe Ifd have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isn\'t it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job--as I\'m sure you can easily imagine--is terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there aren\'t any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually itfs a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, that\'s about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine--those kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints--the sheer number--is enough to dampen anyonefs spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, wefve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office wefve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call gTri-level Rationality Evaluation.h In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customersf homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customerfs fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were--ready? listen carefully!--we cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet I\'m saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside--and actually I leave it aside a lot--my personal reaction to your plight--having mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms--is one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And itfs not although I\'m no good at writing letters. Itfs just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least that\'s what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask--who wouldn\'t ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me--to cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please don\'t get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. Itfs not the kangaroosf fault and itfs not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. That\'s all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. Itfs going nowhere. Say I write the word gcoincidenceh. What you read in the word gcoincidenceh could be utterly different--even opposite--from what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while youfve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.  (Whistling--eight bars of Colonel Bogie\'s March)  Testing, can you hear me?  I don\'t really know how you will take to receiving this letter--that is, this tape--I really can\'t imagine. I suppose you might even get quite upset by it all. Why?c because itfs highly unusual for a product control clerk of a department store to reply to a customer complaint by cassette tape--with a personalized message, too, mind you!--you could even, if you were so inclined, say the whole thing was downright bizarre. And say, were you to get so upset that you sent this tape back to my boss, my standing within the organization would be placed in a terribly delicate balance indeed.  But if that is what you want to do please do so.  If it comes to that, I will not get mad or hold grudge against you.  Clear enough? We are on 100% equal term: I have the right to send you a letter and you have the right to threaten my livelihood.  Isn\'t that right?  Wefre even-steven. Just remember that.  Come to think of it, I forgot to mention that I\'m calling this letter The Kangaroo Communiqué.  I mean, everything needs a name, right?  Suppose, for instance, you keep a diary. Instead of writing this tong, drawn out entry. gDepartment store product control clerkfs reply re. complaint arrives,h you could simply write Kangaroo Communiqué arrivesh and be done with it. And such a catchy name, too, don\'t you think? The Kangaroo Communiqué: makes you think of kangaroos bounding off across the vast plains, pouches stuffed full of mail. Doesn\'t it?  Thump, thump, thump (rapping on tabletop).  Now for some knocking.  Knock, knockc Stop me if youfve heard this.  Don\'t open the door if you don\'t feel like it. Either way is perfectly fine. If you don\'t want to listen any more, please stop the tape and throw it away. I just wanted to sit down a while by your front door talking to myself, that\'s all. I have no idea whatsoever if youfre listening or not, but since I don\'t know, it\'s really all the same whether you do or you don\'t, isn\'t it? Ha, ha, ha.  Okay, what the hell, letfs give it a go.  Still and all, this imperfection business is pretty tough going. Whofd have thought talking into a microphone without any script or plan would be so hard? Itfs like standing in the middle of the desert sprinkling water around with a cup. No visible sign of anything, not one thing to cling to.  That\'s why all this time Ifve been talking to the VU meters. You know, the VU meters? Those gizmos with the needles that twitch to the volume. I don\'t know what the V or the U stand for, but whatever, theyfre the only thing showing any reaction to my ranting.  Hey hey.  All the same, their criteria are really quite simple.  V and U, well, theyfre like a vaudeville duo. Therefs no V without U and no U without V--a nice little set up. As far as theyfre concerned it really doesn\'t matter what I babble on about. The only thing theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air vibrate. To them, the air vibrates therefore I am.  Pretty swift, don\'t you think?  Watching them, I get to thinking it doesn\'t matter what I say so long as I keep talking.  Whoah!  Come to think of it, not too long ago I saw a movie. It was about a comedian who just couldn\'t make anyone laugh no matter what jokes he told. Got the picture? Not one soul would laugh.  Well, talking into this microphone, I\'m reminded of that movie over and over again.  Itfs all very odd.  Lines spoken by one person will have you dying with laughter, but the very same lines spoken by another won\'t seem funny in the least. Curious, don\'t you think? And the more I think about it, that difference just seems to be one of these things youfre born with. See, itfs like the curvature of the semicircular canals of your cars having the edge over somebody elsefs, or... you know.  Sometimes I find myself thinking, if only I had such gifts, how happy Ifd be. I\'m always doubling over laughing to myself when something funny strikes me, but try to tell someone else and it falls flat, a dud. It makes me feel like the Egyptian Sandman. Even more, itfs...  You know about the Egyptian Sandman?  Hmm, well you see, the Egyptian Sandman was Prince of Egypt by birth. A long time ago, back in the days of pyramids and sphinxes and all that. But because he was so ugly--I mean truly ugly--the King had him sent off into the deepest jungle to get rid of him. Well, it so happens that the kid ends up getting raised by wolves, or monkeys maybe. One of those stories, you know. And somehow or other he becomes a Sandman. Now this sandman, everything he touches turns to sand. Breezes turn into sandstorm, babbling brooks turn to sand drifts, grassy plains turn to desert. So goes the tale of the Sandman. Ever hear it before? Probably not, eh? That\'s because I just made it up. Ha, ha, ha.  Anyway, talking to you like this, I get the feeling Ifve become the Egyptian Sandman myself. And what I touch. Itfs sand, sand, sandc  ...Once again. I see I\'m talking about myself too much. But all things considered, itfs unavoidable. I mean, I don\'t even know one solitary thing about you. Ifve got your address and your name, and that\'s it. Your age, income bracket, the shape of your nose, whether youfre slender or overweight, married or not--what do I know? Not that any of that really matters. Itfs almost better this way. If at all possible I prefer to keep things simple, very simple, on the metaphysical level if you will.  To wit, here I have your letter.  This is all I need.  Just as the zoologist collects shit samples in the jungle from which to deduce the elephantfs dietary habits and patterns of activity and weight and sex life, so your one latter gives me enough to go on. I can actually sense what makes up your person. Of course, minus your looks, the kind of perfume you wear, details like that. Nonetheless--your very essence.  Your letter was honestly quite fascinating. Your choice of words, the handwriting, punctuation, spacing between lines, rhetoric, everything was perfect. Superlative, it was not. But perfect, yes.  Every month I read over five hundred letters, and frankly yours was the first letter that ever moved me. I secretly took your letter home with me and read it over and over again. Then I analyzed your letter thoroughly. Being such a short letter, it was no trouble at all.  Many things came to light through my analysis. First of all, the number of punctuation marks is overwhelming. 6.36 commas for every period. On the high side, don\'t you think? And that\'s not all: the way you punctuate is markedly irregular.  Listen, please don\'t think I\'m putting down your writing. I\'m simply moved by it.  Enthralled.  And itfs not just the commas either. Every part of your letter--down to each ink smear--everything set me off, everything shook me.  Why?  Well the long and the short of it is, therefs no you in the whole piece of writing. Oh, therefs a story to it alright. A girl--aman--makes a mistake buying a record. She had the feeling the record had the wrong tunes, but still she went ahead and bought it, and itfs exactly one week before she realizes. The sales girl won\'t exchange it. So she writes a letter of complaint. That\'s the story.  I had to reread your letter three times before I grasped the story. The reason was, your letter was completely different from all the other letters of complaint that come our way. To put it bluntly, there wasn\'t even any complaint in your letter. Let alone any emotion. The only thing that was there--was the story.  Really and truly, you had me wondering. Was the letter in fact intended as a complaint or a confession or a proclamation, or was it perhaps meant to put forth some thesis? I had no idea. Your letter reminded me of a news photo from the scene of a massacre. With no commentary, no article, no nothing--just a photo. A shot of dead bodies littered along some roadside in some country somewhere.  Bang bang bang... therefs your massacre.  No wait, we carn simplify things a little. Simplify them a lot.  That is to say, your letter excites me sexually.  There you have it.   Let us now address the topic of sex.  Thud, thud, thud.  More knocking.  You know, if this doesn\'t interest you, you can stop the tape. I\'m just talking to myself, blabbering away to the VU meters. Blah, blah, blah.  Okay?   Picture this; short forearms with five fingers, but singularly huge hind legs with four toes, the fourth of which is immensely overdeveloped, while the second and third are extra tiny and fused togetherc that\'s a description of the feet of a kangaroo. Ha ha ha.  Uh, moving on the topic of sex.  Ever since I took your letter home with me, all I can seem to think about is sleeping with you. That I\'ll climb into bed to find you next to me, wake up in the morning and there youfd be. As I open my eyes youfll already be getting out of bed, and I\'ll hear you zipping up your dress. There Ifd be--and you know how delicate a zipper on a dress can be--well, Ifd just shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep. I wouldn\'t even set eye on you.  Once you cut across the room and disappear into the washroom, only then would I open my eyes. Then Ifd get a bite to eat and head out to work.  In the pitch black of night--I\'ll install special blinds on my windows to make the place extra pitch black--of course I wouldn\'t see your face. Ifd know nothing, not your age or weight. So I wouldn\'t lay a hand on you either.  But, well, that\'s fine.  If you realty want to know, it makes no difference whatsoever if I have sex with you or not.  No. I take that back.  Let me think that one over.   Okay, letfs put it this way. I would like to sleep with you. But itfs alright if I don\'t sleep with you. What I\'m saying is Ifd like to be as fair as possible. I don\'t want to force anything on anybody, any more than Ifd want anything forced on me. Itfs enough that I feel your presence or see your commas swirling around me.  You see, itfs like this.  Sometimes when I think about entities--like in gseparate entitiesh--it gets mighty grim. I start thinking, and I nearly go to pieces.  cFor instance, say youfre riding on the subway. And there are dozens of people in the car. Mere gpassengersh youfd have to call them, as a rule. gPassengersh being conveyed from Aoyama 1-chome to Akasakamitsuke. Sometimes, though, itfll strike you, that each and every one of those passengers is a distinct individual entity. Like, what does this one do? Or why on earth do you suppose that onefs riding the Ginza Line? Or whatever. By then itfs too late. You let it get to you and youfre a goner.  Looks like that businessmanfs hairline is receding, or the girl over therefs got such hairy legs I bet she shaves at least once a week, or why is that young guy sitting across the aisle wearing that awful color tie? Little things like that. Until finally youfve got the shakes and you want to jump out of the car then and there. Why just the other day--I know youfre going to laugh, but--I was on the verge of pressing the emergency brake button by the door.  I admit it. But that doesn\'t mean you should go thinking I\'m hypersensitive or on edge all the time. I\'m really a regular sort of guy, your everyday ordinary work-a-day type, gainfully employed in the product control section of a department store. And Ifve got nothing against the subway.  Nor do I have any problem sexually. There\'s a woman I\'m seeing--I guess you could call her my girlfriend--been sleeping with her twice a week for maybe a year now. And she and I, wefre both pretty satisfied. Only I try not to take her too seriously. I have no intention of marrying her. If I thought about getting married, I\'m sure Ifd begin taking her seriously, and Ifd lose all confidence that I could carry on from that point. I mean that\'s how it is. You live with a girl and these things start to get to you--her teeth aren\'t exactly straight, the shape of her fingernails--how can you expect to go on like that?   Let me say a little more about myself.  No knocking this time.  If youfve listened this far, you might as well hear me out.  Just a second.

To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldnft be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe Ifd have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isnft it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job&mdashas Ifm sure you can easily imagine&mdashis terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there arenft any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually itfs a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, thatfs about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine&mdashthose kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints&mdashthe sheer number&mdashis enough to dampen anyonefs spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, wefve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office wefve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call gTri-level Rationality Evaluation.h In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customersf homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customerfs fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were&mdashready? listen carefully!&mdashwe cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet Ifm saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside&mdashand actually I leave it aside a lot&mdashmy personal reaction to your plight&mdashhaving mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms&mdashis one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And itfs not although Ifm no good at writing letters. Itfs just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least thatfs what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask&mdashwho wouldnft ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me&mdashto cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please donft get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. Itfs not the kangaroosf fault and itfs not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. Thatfs all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. Itfs going nowhere. Say I write the word gcoincidenceh. What you read in the word gcoincidenceh could be utterly different&mdasheven opposite&mdashfrom what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while youfve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.  (Whistling&mdasheight bars of Colonel Bogiefs March)  Testing, can you hear me?  I donft really know how you will take to receiving this letter&mdashthat is, this tape&mdashI really canft imagine. I suppose you might even get quite upset by it all. Why?c because itfs highly unusual for a product control clerk of a department store to reply to a customer complaint by cassette tape&mdashwith a personalized message, too, mind you!&mdashyou could even, if you were so inclined, say the whole thing was downright bizarre. And say, were you to get so upset that you sent this tape back to my boss, my standing within the organization would be placed in a terribly delicate balance indeed.  But if that is what you want to do please do so.  If it comes to that, I will not get mad or hold grudge against you.  Clear enough? We are on 100% equal term: I have the right to send you a letter and you have the right to threaten my livelihood.  Isnft that right?  Wefre even-steven. Just remember that.  Come to think of it, I forgot to mention that Ifm calling this letter The Kangaroo Communiqué.  I mean, everything needs a name, right?  Suppose, for instance, you keep a diary. Instead of writing this tong, drawn out entry. gDepartment store product control clerkfs reply re. complaint arrives,h you could simply write gKangaroo Communiqué arrivesh and be done with it. And such a catchy name, too, donft you think? The Kangaroo Communiqué: makes you think of kangaroos bounding off across the vast plains, pouches stuffed full of mail. Doesnft it?  Thump, thump, thump (rapping on tabletop).  Now for some knocking.  Knock, knockc Stop me if youfve heard this.  Donft open the door if you donft feel like it. Either way is perfectly fine. If you donft want to listen any more, please stop the tape and throw it away. I just wanted to sit down a while by your front door talking to myself, thatfs all. I have no idea whatsoever if youfre listening or not, but since I donft know, itfs really all the same whether you do or you donft, isnft it? Ha, ha, ha.  Okay, what the hell, letfs give it a go.  Still and all, this imperfection business is pretty tough going. Whofd have thought talking into a microphone without any script or plan would be so hard? Itfs like standing in the middle of the desert sprinkling water around with a cup. No visible sign of anything, not one thing to cling to.  Thatfs why all this time Ifve been talking to the VU meters. You know, the VU meters? Those gizmos with the needles that twitch to the volume. I donft know what the V or the U stand for, but whatever, theyfre the only thing showing any reaction to my ranting.  Hey hey.  All the same, their criteria are really quite simple.  V and U, well, theyfre like a vaudeville duo. Therefs no V without U and no U without V&mdasha nice little set up. As far as theyfre concerned it really doesnft matter what I babble on about. The only thing theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air vibrate. To them, the air vibrates therefore I am.  Pretty swift, donft you think?  Watching them, I get to thinking it doesnft matter what I say so long as I keep talking.  Whoah!  Come to think of it, not too long ago I saw a movie. It was about a comedian who just couldnft make anyone laugh no matter what jokes he told. Got the picture? Not one soul would laugh.  Well, talking into this microphone, Ifm reminded of that movie over and over again.  Itfs all very odd.  Lines spoken by one person will have you dying with laughter, but the very same lines spoken by another wonft seem funny in the least. Curious, donft you think? And the more I think about it, that difference just seems to be one of these things youfre born with. See, itfs like the curvature of the semicircular canals of your cars having the edge over somebody elsefs, or... you know.  Sometimes I find myself thinking, if only I had such gifts, how happy Ifd be. Ifm always doubling over laughing to myself when something funny strikes me, but try to tell someone else and it falls flat, a dud. It makes me feel like the Egyptian Sandman. Even more, itfs...  You know about the Egyptian Sandman?  Hmm, well you see, the Egyptian Sandman was Prince of Egypt by birth. A long time ago, back in the days of pyramids and sphinxes and all that. But because he was so ugly&mdashI mean truly ugly&mdashthe King had him sent off into the deepest jungle to get rid of him. Well, it so happens that the kid ends up getting raised by wolves, or monkeys maybe. One of those stories, you know. And somehow or other he becomes a Sandman. Now this sandman, everything he touches turns to sand. Breezes turn into sandstorm, babbling brooks turn to sand drifts, grassy plains turn to desert. So goes the tale of the Sandman. Ever hear it before? Probably not, eh? Thatfs because I just made it up. Ha, ha, ha.  Anyway, talking to you like this, I get the feeling Ifve become the Egyptian Sandman myself. And what I touch. Itfs sand, sand, sandc  ...Once again. I see Ifm talking about myself too much. But all things considered, itfs unavoidable. I mean, I donft even know one solitary thing about you. Ifve got your address and your name, and thatfs it. Your age, income bracket, the shape of your nose, whether youfre slender or overweight, married or not&mdashwhat do I know? Not that any of that really matters. Itfs almost better this way. If at all possible I prefer to keep things simple, very simple, on the metaphysical level if you will.  To wit, here I have your letter.  This is all I need.  Just as the zoologist collects shit samples in the jungle from which to deduce the elephantfs dietary habits and patterns of activity and weight and sex life, so your one latter gives me enough to go on. I can actually sense what makes up your person. Of course, minus your looks, the kind of perfume you wear, details like that. Nonetheless&mdashyour very essence.  Your letter was honestly quite fascinating. Your choice of words, the handwriting, punctuation, spacing between lines, rhetoric, everything was perfect. Superlative, it was not. But perfect, yes.  Every month I read over five hundred letters, and frankly yours was the first letter that ever moved me. I secretly took your letter home with me and read it over and over again. Then I analyzed your letter thoroughly. Being such a short letter, it was no trouble at all.  Many things came to light through my analysis. First of all, the number of punctuation marks is overwhelming. 6.36 commas for every period. On the high side, donft you think? And thatfs not all: the way you punctuate is markedly irregular.  Listen, please donft think Ifm putting down your writing. Ifm simply moved by it.  Enthralled.  And itfs not just the commas either. Every part of your letter&mdashdown to each ink smear&mdasheverything set me off, everything shook me.  Why?  Well the long and the short of it is, therefs no you in the whole piece of writing. Oh, therefs a story to it alright. A girl&mdasha woman&mdashmakes a mistake buying a record. She had the feeling the record had the wrong tunes, but still she went ahead and bought it, and itfs exactly one week before she realizes. The sales girl wonft exchange it. So she writes a letter of complaint. Thatfs the story.  I had to reread your letter three times before I grasped the story. The reason was, your letter was completely different from all the other letters of complaint that come our way. To put it bluntly, there wasnft even any complaint in your letter. Let alone any emotion. The only thing that was there&mdashwas the story.  Really and truly, you had me wondering. Was the letter in fact intended as a complaint or a confession or a proclamation, or was it perhaps meant to put forth some thesis? I had no idea. Your letter reminded me of a news photo from the scene of a massacre. With no commentary, no article, no nothing&mdashjust a photo. A shot of dead bodies littered along some roadside in some country somewhere.  Bang bang bang... therefs your massacre.  No wait, we carn simplify things a little. Simplify them a lot.  That is to say, your letter excites me sexually.  There you have it.   Let us now address the topic of sex.  Thud, thud, thud.  More knocking.  You know, if this doesnft interest you, you can stop the tape. Ifm just talking to myself, blabbering away to the VU meters. Blah, blah, blah.  Okay?   Picture this; short forearms with five fingers, but singularly huge hind legs with four toes, the fourth of which is immensely overdeveloped, while the second and third are extra tiny and fused togetherc thatfs a description of the feet of a kangaroo. Ha ha ha.  Uh, moving on the topic of sex.  Ever since I took your letter home with me, all I can seem to think about is sleeping with you. That Ifll climb into bed to find you next to me, wake up in the morning and there youfd be. As I open my eyes youfll already be getting out of bed, and Ifll hear you zipping up your dress. There Ifd be&mdashand you know how delicate a zipper on a dress can be&mdashwell, Ifd just shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep. I wouldnft even set eye on you.  Once you cut across the room and disappear into the washroom, only then would I open my eyes. Then Ifd get a bite to eat and head out to work.  In the pitch black of night&mdashIfll install special blinds on my windows to make the place extra pitch black&mdashof course I wouldnft see your face. Ifd know nothing, not your age or weight. So I wouldnft lay a hand on you either.  But, well, thatfs fine.  If you realty want to know, it makes no difference whatsoever if I have sex with you or not.  cNo. I take that back.  Let me think that one over.   Okay, letfs put it this way. I would like to sleep with you. But itfs alright if I donft sleep with you. What Ifm saying is Ifd like to be as fair as possible. I donft want to force anything on anybody, any more than Ifd want anything forced on me. Itfs enough that I feel your presence or see your commas swirling around me.  You see, itfs like this.  Sometimes when I think about entities&mdashlike in gseparate entitiesh&mdashit gets mighty grim. I start thinking, and I nearly go to pieces.  cFor instance, say youfre riding on the subway. And there are dozens of people in the car. Mere gpassengersh youfd have to call them, as a rule. gPassengersh being conveyed from Aoyama 1-chome to Akasakamitsuke. Sometimes, though, itfll strike you, that each and every one of those passengers is a distinct individual entity. Like, what does this one do? Or why on earth do you suppose that onefs riding the Ginza Line? Or whatever. By then itfs too late. You let it get to you and youfre a goner.  Looks like that businessmanfs hairline is receding, or the girl over therefs got such hairy legs I bet she shaves at least once a week, or why is that young guy sitting across the aisle wearing that awful color tie? Little things like that. Until finally youfve got the shakes and you want to jump out of the car then and there. Why just the other day&mdashI know youfre going to laugh, but&mdashI was on the verge of pressing the emergency brake button by the door.  I admit it. But that doesnft mean you should go thinking Ifm hypersensitive or on edge all the time. Ifm really a regular sort of guy, your everyday ordinary work-a-day type, gainfully employed in the product control section of a department store. And Ifve got nothing against the subway.  Nor do I have any problem sexually. Therefs a woman Ifm seeing&mdashI guess you could call her my girlfriend&mdashbeen sleeping with her twice a week for maybe a year now. And she and I, wefre both pretty satisfied. Only I try not to take her too seriously. I have no intention of marrying her. If I thought about getting married, Ifm sure Ifd begin taking her seriously, and Ifd lose all confidence that I could carry on from that point. I mean thatfs how it is. You live with a girl and these things start to get to you&mdashher teeth arenft exactly straight, the shape of her fingernails&mdashhow can you expect to go on like that?   Let me say a little more about myself.  No knocking this time.  If youfve listened this far, you might as well hear me out.  Just a second. I need a smoke.  Rattle, rattle.  cUp to now Ifve hardly said a word about myself. Like, therefs really not that much to say. And even if I did, probably nobody would find it terribly interesting.  So why am I telling you all this?  I think I already told you, itfs because now my sights are set on the Nobility of Imperfection.  And what touched off this Nobility of Imperfection idea?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Yes, kangaroos.  Kangaroos are such fascinating creatures, I can look at them for hours on end. What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and thatfs it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If shefs not pregnant, shefs nursing babies, if shefs not nursing babies, shefs pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldnft survive if there werenft any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasnft to go on existing, kangaroos wouldnft be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But Ifm getting ahead of myself. Excuse me.  To talk about myself, then.  Actually, Ifm extremely dissatisfied with being who I am. Itfs nothing to do with my looks or abilities or status or any of that. It simply has to do with being me. The situation strikes me as grossly unfair.  Still, that doesnft mean you should write me off as someone with a lot of gripes. I have not one complaint about the place where I work or my salary. The work is undeniably boring, but then most jobs are boring. Money it not a major issue here.  Shall I put it on the line?  I want to be able to be in two places at once. That is my one and only wish. Other than that, therefs not a thing I desire.  Yet being who and what I am, my singularity hampers this desire of mine. An unhappy lot, donft you think? My wish, if anything, is rather unassuming. I donft want to be ruler of the world, nor do I want to be an artist of genius. I merely want to exist in two places simultaneously. Got itf Not three, not four, only two. I want to be roller skating while Ifm listening to an orchestra at a concert hall. I want to be a MacDonaldfs Quarter-Pounder and still be a clerk in the product control section of the department store. I want to sleep with you and be sleeping with my girlfriend all the while. I went to lead a general existence and yet be a distinct, separate entity.  Allow me one more cigarette.  Whoah.  Getting a little tired.  Ifm not used to this, speaking so frankly about myself.  Therefs just one thing Ifd like to get clear, though. Which is that do not lust after you sexually as a woman. Like I told you, I am angry at the fact that I am only myself and nothing else. This being a solitary entity is dreadfully depressing. Hence I do not seek to sleep with you, a solitary individual.  If, however, you were to divide in two, and I split into two as well, and we four all shared the same bed together, wouldnft that be something! Donft you think?  Please send no reply. If you decide you want to write sue a letter, please send it ease of the company in the form of a complaint. If not a complaint, then whatever you come up with.  Thatfs about it.   I listened to the tape this far on playback just now. To be honest, Ifm very dissatisfied with it. I feel like an aquarium trainer whofs let a seal die out of negligence. It made me worry whether I should even send you this tape or not, blowing this thing all out of proportion even by my standards.  And now that Ifve decided to send it, Ifm still worried.  But what the hell, Ifm striving for imperfection. So Ifve got to live happily by my choice. It was you and the four kangaroos who got me into this imperfection after all.  Signing off.',NULL),(432,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:13e6346:fe2f85b0a7:-7fff','2004-08-05 11:16:29',1,'The Kangaroo Communiqué By MURAKAMI Haruki Translated by Alfred Birnbaum\n Say hey, how\'s tricks?  This morning I paid a call on the kangaroos at the local zoo. Not your biggest zoo, but itfs got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, don\'t go out of your way. You won\'t find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I can\'t for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I can\'t figure it out.  Though, really, that\'s neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind.

The only thing theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air vibrate. To them, the air vibrates therefore I am.  Pretty swift, don\'t you think?  Watching them, I get to thinking it doesn\'t matter what I say so long as I keep talking.  Whoah!  Come to think of it, not too long ago I saw a movie. It was about a comedian who just couldn\'t make anyone laugh no matter what jokes he told. Got the picture? Not one soul would laugh.  Well, talking into this microphone, I\'m reminded of that movie over and over again.  Itfs all very odd.  Lines spoken by one person will have you dying with laughter, but the very same lines spoken by another won\'t seem funny in the least. Curious, don\'t you think? And the more I think about it, that difference just seems to be one of these things youfre born with. See, itfs like the curvature of the semicircular canals of your cars having the edge over somebody elsefs, or... you know.  Sometimes I find myself thinking, if only I had such gifts, how happy Ifd be. I\'m always doubling over laughing to myself when something funny strikes me, but try to tell someone else and it falls flat, a dud. It makes me feel like the Egyptian Sandman. Even more, itfs...  You know about the Egyptian Sandman?  Hmm, well you see, the Egyptian Sandman was Prince of Egypt by birth. A long time ago, back in the days of pyramids and sphinxes and all that. But because he was so ugly--I mean truly ugly--the King had him sent off into the deepest jungle to get rid of him. Well, it so happens that the kid ends up getting raised by wolves, or monkeys maybe. One of those stories, you know. And somehow or other he becomes a Sandman. Now this sandman, everything he touches turns to sand. Breezes turn into sandstorm, babbling brooks turn to sand drifts, grassy plains turn to desert. So goes the tale of the Sandman. Ever hear it before? Probably not, eh? That\'s because I just made it up. Ha, ha, ha.  Anyway, talking to you like this, I get the feeling Ifve become the Egyptian Sandman myself. And what I touch. Itfs sand, sand, sandc  ...Once again. I see I\'m talking about myself too much. But all things considered, itfs unavoidable. I mean, I don\'t even know one solitary thing about you. Ifve got your address and your name, and that\'s it. Your age, income bracket, the shape of your nose, whether youfre slender or overweight, married or not--what do I know? Not that any of that really matters. Itfs almost better this way. If at all possible I prefer to keep things simple, very simple, on the metaphysical level if you will.  To wit, here I have your letter.  This is all I need.  Just as the zoologist collects shit samples in the jungle from which to deduce the elephantfs dietary habits and patterns of activity and weight and sex life, so your one latter gives me enough to go on. I can actually sense what makes up your person. Of course, minus your looks, the kind of perfume you wear, details like that. Nonetheless--your very essence.  Your letter was honestly quite fascinating. Your choice of words, the handwriting, punctuation, spacing between lines, rhetoric, everything was perfect. Superlative, it was not. But perfect, yes.  Every month I read over five hundred letters, and frankly yours was the first letter that ever moved me. I secretly took your letter home with me and read it over and over again. Then I analyzed your letter thoroughly. Being such a short letter, it was no trouble at all.  Many things came to light through my analysis. First of all, the number of punctuation marks is overwhelming. 6.36 commas for every period. On the high side, don\'t you think? And that\'s not all: the way you punctuate is markedly irregular.  Listen, please don\'t think I\'m putting down your writing. I\'m simply moved by it.  Enthralled.  And itfs not just the commas either. Every part of your letter--down to each ink smear--everything set me off, everything shook me.  Why?  Well the long and the short of it is, therefs no you in the whole piece of writing. Oh, therefs a story to it alright. A girl--aman--makes a mistake buying a record. She had the feeling the record had the wrong tunes, but still she went ahead and bought it, and itfs exactly one week before she realizes. The sales girl won\'t exchange it. So she writes a letter of complaint. That\'s the story.  I had to reread your letter three times before I grasped the story. The reason was, your letter was completely different from all the other letters of complaint that come our way. To put it bluntly, there wasn\'t even any complaint in your letter. Let alone any emotion. The only thing that was there--was the story.  Really and truly, you had me wondering. Was the letter in fact intended as a complaint or a confession or a proclamation, or was it perhaps meant to put forth some thesis? I had no idea. Your letter reminded me of a news photo from the scene of a massacre. With no commentary, no article, no nothing--just a photo. A shot of dead bodies littered along some roadside in some country somewhere.  Bang bang bang... therefs your massacre.  No wait, we carn simplify things a little. Simplify them a lot.  That is to say, your letter excites me sexually.  There you have it.   Let us now address the topic of sex.  Thud, thud, thud.  More knocking.  You know, if this doesn\'t interest you, you can stop the tape. I\'m just talking to myself, blabbering away to the VU meters. Blah, blah, blah.  Okay?   Picture this; short forearms with five fingers, but singularly huge hind legs with four toes, the fourth of which is immensely overdeveloped, while the second and third are extra tiny and fused togetherc that\'s a description of the feet of a kangaroo. Ha ha ha.  Uh, moving on the topic of sex.  Ever since I took your letter home with me, all I can seem to think about is sleeping with you. That I\'ll climb into bed to find you next to me, wake up in the morning and there youfd be. As I open my eyes youfll already be getting out of bed, and I\'ll hear you zipping up your dress. There Ifd be--and you know how delicate a zipper on a dress can be--well, Ifd just shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep. I wouldn\'t even set eye on you.  Once you cut across the room and disappear into the washroom, only then would I open my eyes. Then Ifd get a bite to eat and head out to work.  In the pitch black of night--I\'ll install special blinds on my windows to make the place extra pitch black--of course I wouldn\'t see your face. Ifd know nothing, not your age or weight. So I wouldn\'t lay a hand on you either.  But, well, that\'s fine.  If you realty want to know, it makes no difference whatsoever if I have sex with you or not.  No. I take that back.  Let me think that one over.   Okay, letfs put it this way. I would like to sleep with you. But itfs alright if I don\'t sleep with you. What I\'m saying is Ifd like to be as fair as possible. I don\'t want to force anything on anybody, any more than Ifd want anything forced on me. Itfs enough that I feel your presence or see your commas swirling around me.  You see, itfs like this.  Sometimes when I think about entities--like in gseparate entitiesh--it gets mighty grim. I start thinking, and I nearly go to pieces.  cFor instance, say youfre riding on the subway. And there are dozens of people in the car. Mere gpassengersh youfd have to call them, as a rule. gPassengersh being conveyed from Aoyama 1-chome to Akasakamitsuke. Sometimes, though, itfll strike you, that each and every one of those passengers is a distinct individual entity. Like, what does this one do? Or why on earth do you suppose that onefs riding the Ginza Line? Or whatever. By then itfs too late. You let it get to you and youfre a goner.  Looks like that businessmanfs hairline is receding, or the girl over therefs got such hairy legs I bet she shaves at least once a week, or why is that young guy sitting across the aisle wearing that awful color tie? Little things like that. Until finally youfve got the shakes and you want to jump out of the car then and there. Why just the other day--I know youfre going to laugh, but--I was on the verge of pressing the emergency brake button by the door.  I admit it. But that doesn\'t mean you should go thinking I\'m hypersensitive or on edge all the time. I\'m really a regular sort of guy, your everyday ordinary work-a-day type, gainfully employed in the product control section of a department store. And Ifve got nothing against the subway.  Nor do I have any problem sexually. There\'s a woman I\'m seeing--I guess you could call her my girlfriend--been sleeping with her twice a week for maybe a year now. And she and I, wefre both pretty satisfied. Only I try not to take her too seriously. I have no intention of marrying her. If I thought about getting married, I\'m sure Ifd begin taking her seriously, and Ifd lose all confidence that I could carry on from that point. I mean that\'s how it is. You live with a girl and these things start to get to you--her teeth aren\'t exactly straight, the shape of her fingernails--how can you expect to go on like that?   Let me say a little more about myself.  No knocking this time.  If youfve listened this far, you might as well hear me out.  Just a second. I need a smoke.  Rattle, rattle.  cUp to now Ifve hardly said a word about myself. Like, therefs really not that much to say. And even if I did, probably nobody would find it terribly interesting.  So why am I telling you all this?  I think I already told you, itfs because now my sights are set on the Nobility of Imperfection.  And what touched off this Nobility of Imperfection idea?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Yes, kangaroos.  Kangaroos are such fascinating creatures, I can look at them for hours on end. What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and that\'s it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If shefs not pregnant, shefs nursing babies, if shefs not nursing babies, shefs pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldn\'t survive if there weren\'t any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasn\'t to go on existing, kangaroos wouldn\'t be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But I\'m getting ahead of myself. Excuse me.  To talk about myself, then.  Actually, I\'m extremely dissatisfied with being who I am. Itfs nothing to do with my looks or abilities or status or any of that. It simply has to do with being me. The situation strikes me as grossly unfair.  Still, that doesn\'t mean you should write me off as someone with a lot of gripes. I have not one complaint about the place where I work or my salary. The work is undeniably boring, but then most jobs are boring. Money it not a major issue here.  Shall I put it on the line?  I want to be able to be in two places at once. That is my one and only wish. Other than that, therefs not a thing I desire.  Yet being who and what I am, my singularity hampers this desire of mine. An unhappy lot, don\'t you think? My wish, if anything, is rather unassuming. I don\'t want to be ruler of the world, nor do I want to be an artist of genius. I merely want to exist in two places simultaneously. Got itf Not three, not four, only two. I want to be roller skating while I\'m listening to an orchestra at a concert hall. I want to be a MacDonaldfs Quarter-Pounder and still be a clerk in the product control section of the department store. I want to sleep with you and be sleeping with my girlfriend all the while. I went to lead a general existence and yet be a distinct, separate entity.  Allow me one more cigarette.  Whoah.  Getting a little tired.  I\'m not used to this, speaking so frankly about myself.  Therefs just one thing Ifd like to get clear, though. Which is that do not lust after you sexually as a woman. Like I told you, I am angry at the fact that I am only myself and nothing else. This being a solitary entity is dreadfully depressing. Hence I do not seek to sleep with you, a solitary individual.  If, however, you were to divide in two, and I split into two as well, and we four all shared the same bed together, wouldn\'t that be something! Don\'t you think?  Please send no reply. If you decide you want to write sue a letter, please send it ease of the company in the form of a complaint. If not a complaint, then whatever you come up with.  That\'s about it.   I listened to the tape this far on playback just now. To be honest, I\'m very dissatisfied with it. I feel like an aquarium trainer whofs let a seal die out of negligence. It made me worry whether I should even send you this tape or not, blowing this thing all out of proportion even by my standards.  And now that Ifve decided to send it, I\'m still worried.  But what the hell, I\'m striving for imperfection. So Ifve got to live happily by my choice. It was you and the four kangaroos who got me into this imperfection after all.  Signing off.\n',36),(433,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:13e6346:fe2f85b0a7:-7ffc','2004-08-05 11:20:07',1,'The Kangaroo Communiqué By MURAKAMI Haruki Translated by Alfred Birnbaum\n Say hey, how\'s tricks?  This morning I paid a call on the kangaroos at the local zoo. Not your biggest zoo, but itfs got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, don\'t go out of your way. You won\'t find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I can\'t for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I can\'t figure it out.  Though, really, that\'s neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind. Kangaroos are kangaroos, you are you.  In other words, itfs like this.  Thirty-six intricate procedural steps, followed one by one in just the right order, led me from the kangaroos to you--that\'s it. To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldn\'t be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe Ifd have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isn\'t it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job--as I\'m sure you can easily imagine--is terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there aren\'t any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually itfs a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, that\'s about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine--those kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints--the sheer number--is enough to dampen anyonefs spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, wefve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office wefve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call gTri-level Rationality Evaluation.h In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customersf homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customerfs fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were--ready? listen carefully!--we cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet I\'m saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside--and actually I leave it aside a lot--my personal reaction to your plight--having mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms--is one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And itfs not although I\'m no good at writing letters. Itfs just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least that\'s what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask--who wouldn\'t ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me--to cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please don\'t get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. Itfs not the kangaroosf fault and itfs not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. That\'s all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. Itfs going nowhere. Say I write the word gcoincidenceh. What you read in the word gcoincidenceh could be utterly different--even opposite--from what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while youfve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.  (Whistling--eight bars of Colonel Bogie\'s March)  Testing, can you hear me?  I don\'t really know how you will take to receiving this letter--that is, this tape--I really can\'t imagine. I suppose you might even get quite upset by it all. Why?c because itfs highly unusual for a product control clerk of a department store to reply to a customer complaint by cassette tape--with a personalized message, too, mind you!--you could even, if you were so inclined, say the whole thing was downright bizarre. And say, were you to get so upset that you sent this tape back to my boss, my standing within the organization would be placed in a terribly delicate balance indeed.  But if that is what you want to do please do so.  If it comes to that, I will not get mad or hold grudge against you.  Clear enough? We are on 100% equal term: I have the right to send you a letter and you have the right to threaten my livelihood.  Isn\'t that right?  Wefre even-steven. Just remember that.  Come to think of it, I forgot to mention that I\'m calling this letter The Kangaroo Communiqué.  I mean, everything needs a name, right?  Suppose, for instance, you keep a diary. Instead of writing this tong, drawn out entry. gDepartment store product control clerkfs reply re. complaint arrives,h you could simply write Kangaroo Communiqué arrivesh and be done with it. And such a catchy name, too, don\'t you think? The Kangaroo Communiqué: makes you think of kangaroos bounding off across the vast plains, pouches stuffed full of mail. Doesn\'t it?  Thump, thump, thump (rapping on tabletop).  Now for some knocking.  Knock, knockc Stop me if youfve heard this.  Don\'t open the door if you don\'t feel like it. Either way is perfectly fine. If you don\'t want to listen any more, please stop the tape and throw it away. I just wanted to sit down a while by your front door talking to myself, that\'s all. I have no idea whatsoever if youfre listening or not, but since I don\'t know, it\'s really all the same whether you do or you don\'t, isn\'t it? Ha, ha, ha.  Okay, what the hell, letfs give it a go.  Still and all, this imperfection business is pretty tough going. Whofd have thought talking into a microphone without any script or plan would be so hard? Itfs like standing in the middle of the desert sprinkling water around with a cup. No visible sign of anything, not one thing to cling to.  That\'s why all this time Ifve been talking to the VU meters. You know, the VU meters? Those gizmos with the needles that twitch to the volume. I don\'t know what the V or the U stand for, but whatever, theyfre the only thing showing any reaction to my ranting.  Hey hey.  All the same, their criteria are really quite simple.  V and U, well, theyfre like a vaudeville duo. Therefs no V without U and no U without V--a nice little set up. As far as theyfre concerned it really doesn\'t matter what I babble on about. The only thing theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air vibrate. To them, the air vibrates therefore I am.  Pretty swift, don\'t you think?  Watching them, I get to thinking it doesn\'t matter what I say so long as I keep talking.  Whoah!  Come to think of it, not too long ago I saw a movie.

But that doesn\'t mean you should go thinking I\'m hypersensitive or on edge all the time. I\'m really a regular sort of guy, your everyday ordinary work-a-day type, gainfully employed in the product control section of a department store. And Ifve got nothing against the subway.  Nor do I have any problem sexually. There\'s a woman I\'m seeing--I guess you could call her my girlfriend--been sleeping with her twice a week for maybe a year now. And she and I, wefre both pretty satisfied. Only I try not to take her too seriously. I have no intention of marrying her. If I thought about getting married, I\'m sure Ifd begin taking her seriously, and Ifd lose all confidence that I could carry on from that point. I mean that\'s how it is. You live with a girl and these things start to get to you--her teeth aren\'t exactly straight, the shape of her fingernails--how can you expect to go on like that?   Let me say a little more about myself.  No knocking this time.  If youfve listened this far, you might as well hear me out.  Just a second. I need a smoke.  Rattle, rattle.  cUp to now Ifve hardly said a word about myself. Like, therefs really not that much to say. And even if I did, probably nobody would find it terribly interesting.  So why am I telling you all this?  I think I already told you, itfs because now my sights are set on the Nobility of Imperfection.  And what touched off this Nobility of Imperfection idea?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Yes, kangaroos.  Kangaroos are such fascinating creatures, I can look at them for hours on end. What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and that\'s it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If shefs not pregnant, shefs nursing babies, if shefs not nursing babies, shefs pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldn\'t survive if there weren\'t any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasn\'t to go on existing, kangaroos wouldn\'t be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But I\'m getting ahead of myself. Excuse me.  To talk about myself, then.  Actually, I\'m extremely dissatisfied with being who I am. Itfs nothing to do with my looks or abilities or status or any of that. It simply has to do with being me. The situation strikes me as grossly unfair.  Still, that doesn\'t mean you should write me off as someone with a lot of gripes. I have not one complaint about the place where I work or my salary. The work is undeniably boring, but then most jobs are boring. Money it not a major issue here.  Shall I put it on the line?  I want to be able to be in two places at once. That is my one and only wish. Other than that, therefs not a thing I desire.  Yet being who and what I am, my singularity hampers this desire of mine. An unhappy lot, don\'t you think? My wish, if anything, is rather unassuming. I don\'t want to be ruler of the world, nor do I want to be an artist of genius. I merely want to exist in two places simultaneously. Got itf Not three, not four, only two. I want to be roller skating while I\'m listening to an orchestra at a concert hall. I want to be a MacDonaldfs Quarter-Pounder and still be a clerk in the product control section of the department store. I want to sleep with you and be sleeping with my girlfriend all the while. I went to lead a general existence and yet be a distinct, separate entity.  Allow me one more cigarette.  Whoah.  Getting a little tired.  I\'m not used to this, speaking so frankly about myself.  Therefs just one thing Ifd like to get clear, though. Which is that do not lust after you sexually as a woman. Like I told you, I am angry at the fact that I am only myself and nothing else. This being a solitary entity is dreadfully depressing. Hence I do not seek to sleep with you, a solitary individual.  If, however, you were to divide in two, and I split into two as well, and we four all shared the same bed together, wouldn\'t that be something! Don\'t you think?  Please send no reply. If you decide you want to write sue a letter, please send it ease of the company in the form of a complaint. If not a complaint, then whatever you come up with.  That\'s about it.   I listened to the tape this far on playback just now. To be honest, I\'m very dissatisfied with it. I feel like an aquarium trainer whofs let a seal die out of negligence. It made me worry whether I should even send you this tape or not, blowing this thing all out of proportion even by my standards.  And now that Ifve decided to send it, I\'m still worried.  But what the hell, I\'m striving for imperfection. So Ifve got to live happily by my choice. It was you and the four kangaroos who got me into this imperfection after all.  Signing off.',NULL),(434,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-8000','2004-08-05 13:41:40',7023,'&ldquo',NULL),(435,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7ffa','2004-08-05 13:41:42',7029,'\"',NULL),(436,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7ff9','2004-08-05 13:41:45',7041,'\"',NULL),(437,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7ff8','2004-08-05 13:41:45',7042,'&rdquo',NULL),(438,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7ff2','2004-08-05 13:41:49',7076,'&ldquo',NULL),(439,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fec','2004-08-05 13:41:51',7082,'\"',NULL),(440,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7feb','2004-08-05 13:41:54',7094,'\"',NULL),(441,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fea','2004-08-05 13:41:55',7095,'&rdquo',NULL),(442,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fe4','2004-08-05 13:42:02',8655,'&ldquo',NULL),(443,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fde','2004-08-05 13:42:04',8661,'\"',NULL),(444,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fdd','2004-08-05 13:42:08',8732,'&rdquo',NULL),(445,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fd7','2004-08-05 13:42:13',8731,'\"',NULL),(446,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fd6','2004-08-05 13:42:16',8762,'&ldquo',NULL),(447,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fd0','2004-08-05 13:42:19',8768,'\"',NULL),(448,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fcf','2004-08-05 13:42:24',8796,'\"',NULL),(449,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fce','2004-08-05 13:42:24',8797,'&rdquo',NULL),(450,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fc8','2004-08-05 13:42:31',17487,'&ldquo',NULL),(451,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fc2','2004-08-05 13:42:34',17493,'\"',NULL),(452,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fc1','2004-08-05 13:42:36',17511,'\"',NULL),(453,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fc0','2004-08-05 13:42:37',17512,'&rdquo',NULL),(454,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fba','2004-08-05 13:42:43',17683,'&ldquo',NULL),(455,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fb4','2004-08-05 13:42:46',17689,'\"',NULL),(456,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fb3','2004-08-05 13:42:48',17700,'\"',NULL),(457,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fb2','2004-08-05 13:42:49',17701,'&rdquo',NULL),(458,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fac','2004-08-05 13:42:54',17744,'&ldquo',NULL),(459,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fa6','2004-08-05 13:42:57',17750,'\"',NULL),(460,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fa5','2004-08-05 13:42:59',17761,'\"',NULL),(461,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7fa4','2004-08-05 13:43:00',17762,'&rdquo',NULL),(462,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7f9e','2004-08-05 13:43:05',3563,'&ldquo',NULL),(463,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7f98','2004-08-05 13:43:08',3569,'\"',NULL),(464,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7f97','2004-08-05 13:43:11',3603,'\"',NULL),(465,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7f96','2004-08-05 13:43:11',3604,'&rdquo',NULL),(466,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7f90','2004-08-05 13:44:50',7692,'c',NULL),(467,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1f30035:fe300ab221:-7f8f','2004-08-05 13:44:51',7693,'...',NULL),(468,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:10c29fe:fe30112ac3:-8000','2004-08-05 13:48:44',13502,'punctuation',NULL),(469,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:10c29fe:fe30112ac3:-7ffe','2004-08-05 13:52:56',266,'&mdash',NULL),(470,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:10c29fe:fe30112ac3:-7ffc','2004-08-05 13:53:55',1662,' eCause therefre 36 of them!',NULL),(471,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:11b1d80:fe30184be2:-8000','2004-08-05 13:56:32',1,'The Kangaroo Communiqué By MURAKAMI Haruki Translated by Alfred Birnbaum\n Say hey, howfs tricks?  This morning I paid a call on the kangaroos at the local zoo. Not your biggest zoo, but itfs got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, donft go out of your way. You wonft find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I canft for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I canft figure it out.  Though, really, thatfs neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind. Kangaroos are kangaroos, you are you.  In other words, itfs like this.  Thirty-six intricate procedural steps, followed one by one in just the right order, led me from the kangaroos to you&mdashthatfs it. To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldnft be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe Ifd have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isnft it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job&mdashas Ifm sure you can easily imagine&mdashis terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there arenft any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually itfs a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, thatfs about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine&mdashthose kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints&mdashthe sheer number&mdashis enough to dampen anyonefs spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, wefve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office wefve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call gTri-level Rationality Evaluation.h In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customersf homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customerfs fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were&mdashready? listen carefully!&mdashwe cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet Ifm saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside&mdashand actually I leave it aside a lot&mdashmy personal reaction to your plight&mdashhaving mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms&mdashis one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And itfs not although Ifm no good at writing letters. Itfs just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least thatfs what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask&mdashwho wouldnft ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me&mdashto cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please donft get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. Itfs not the kangaroosf fault and itfs not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. Thatfs all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. Itfs going nowhere. Say I write the word gcoincidenceh. What you read in the word gcoincidenceh could be utterly different&mdasheven opposite&mdashfrom what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while youfve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.  (Whistling&mdasheight bars of Colonel Bogiefs March)  Testing, can you hear me?  I donft really know how you will take to receiving this letter&mdashthat is, this tape&mdashI really canft imagine. I suppose you might even get quite upset by it all. Why?c because itfs highly unusual for a product control clerk of a department store to reply to a customer complaint by cassette tape&mdashwith a personalized message, too, mind you!&mdashyou could even, if you were so inclined, say the whole thing was downright bizarre. And say, were you to get so upset that you sent this tape back to my boss, my standing within the organization would be placed in a terribly delicate balance indeed.  But if that is what you want to do please do so.  If it comes to that, I will not get mad or hold grudge against you.  Clear enough? We are on 100% equal term: I have the right to send you a letter and you have the right to threaten my livelihood.  Isnft that right?  Wefre even-steven. Just remember that.  Come to think of it, I forgot to mention that Ifm calling this letter The Kangaroo Communiqué.  I mean, everything needs a name, right?  Suppose, for instance, you keep a diary. Instead of writing this tong, drawn out entry. gDepartment store product control clerkfs reply re. complaint arrives,h you could simply write gKangaroo Communiqué arrivesh and be done with it. And such a catchy name, too, donft you think? The Kangaroo Communiqué: makes you think of kangaroos bounding off across the vast plains, pouches stuffed full of mail. Doesnft it?  Thump, thump, thump (rapping on tabletop).  Now for some knocking.  Knock, knockc Stop me if youfve heard this.  Donft open the door if you donft feel like it. Either way is perfectly fine. If you donft want to listen any more, please stop the tape and throw it away. I just wanted to sit down a while by your front door talking to myself, thatfs all. I have no idea whatsoever if youfre listening or not, but since I donft know, itfs really all the same whether you do or you donft, isnft it? Ha, ha, ha.  Okay, what the hell, letfs give it a go.  Still and all, this imperfection business is pretty tough going. Whofd have thought talking into a microphone without any script or plan would be so hard? Itfs like standing in the middle of the desert sprinkling water around with a cup. No visible sign of anything, not one thing to cling to.  Thatfs why all this time Ifve been talking to the VU meters. You know, the VU meters? Those gizmos with the needles that twitch to the volume. I donft know what the V or the U stand for, but whatever, theyfre the only thing showing any reaction to my ranting.  Hey hey.  All the same, their criteria are really quite simple.  V and U, well, theyfre like a vaudeville duo. Therefs no V without U and no U without V&mdasha nice little set up. As far as theyfre concerned it really doesnft matter what I babble on about. The only thing theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air vibrate. To them, the air vibrates therefore I am.  Pretty swift, donft you think?  Watching them, I get to thinking it doesnft matter what I say so long as I keep talking.  Whoah!  Come to think of it, not too long ago I saw a movie. It was about a comedian who just couldnft make anyone laugh no matter what jokes he told. Got the picture? Not one soul would laugh.  Well, talking into this microphone, Ifm reminded of that movie over and over again.  Itfs all very odd.  Lines spoken by one person will have you dying with laughter, but the very same lines spoken by another wonft seem funny in the least. Curious, donft you think? And the more I think about it, that difference just seems to be one of these things youfre born with. See, itfs like the curvature of the semicircular canals of your cars having the edge over somebody elsefs, or... you know.  Sometimes I find myself thinking, if only I had such gifts, how happy Ifd be. Ifm always doubling over laughing to myself when something funny strikes me, but try to tell someone else and it falls flat, a dud. It makes me feel like the Egyptian Sandman. Even more, itfs...  You know about the Egyptian Sandman?  Hmm, well you see, the Egyptian Sandman was Prince of Egypt by birth. A long time ago, back in the days of pyramids and sphinxes and all that. But because he was so ugly&mdashI mean truly ugly&mdashthe King had him sent off into the deepest jungle to get rid of him. Well, it so happens that the kid ends up getting raised by wolves, or monkeys maybe. One of those stories, you know. And somehow or other he becomes a Sandman. Now this sandman, everything he touches turns to sand. Breezes turn into sandstorm, babbling brooks turn to sand drifts, grassy plains turn to desert. So goes the tale of the Sandman. Ever hear it before? Probably not, eh? Thatfs because I just made it up. Ha, ha, ha.  Anyway, talking to you like this, I get the feeling Ifve become the Egyptian Sandman myself. And what I touch. Itfs sand, sand, sandc  ...Once again. I see Ifm talking about myself too much. But all things considered, itfs unavoidable. I mean, I donft even know one solitary thing about you. Ifve got your address and your name, and thatfs it. Your age, income bracket, the shape of your nose, whether youfre slender or overweight, married or not&mdashwhat do I know? Not that any of that really matters. Itfs almost better this way. If at all possible I prefer to keep things simple, very simple, on the metaphysical level if you will.  To wit, here I have your letter.  This is all I need.  Just as the zoologist collects shit samples in the jungle from which to deduce the elephantfs dietary habits and patterns of activity and weight and sex life, so your one latter gives me enough to go on. I can actually sense what makes up your person. Of course, minus your looks, the kind of perfume you wear, details like that. Nonetheless&mdashyour very essence.  Your letter was honestly quite fascinating. Your choice of words, the handwriting, punctuation, spacing between lines, rhetoric, everything was perfect. Superlative, it was not. But perfect, yes.  Every month I read over five hundred letters, and frankly yours was the first letter that ever moved me. I secretly took your letter home with me and read it over and over again. Then I analyzed your letter thoroughly. Being such a short letter, it was no trouble at all.  Many things came to light through my analysis. First of all, the number of punctuation marks is overwhelming. 6.36 commas for every period. On the high side, donft you think? And thatfs not all: the way you punctuate is markedly irregular.  Listen, please donft think Ifm putting down your writing. Ifm simply moved by it.  Enthralled.  And itfs not just the commas either. Every part of your letter&mdashdown to each ink smear&mdasheverything set me off, everything shook me.  Why?  Well the long and the short of it is, therefs no you in the whole piece of writing. Oh, therefs a story to it alright. A girl&mdasha woman&mdashmakes a mistake buying a record. She had the feeling the record had the wrong tunes, but still she went ahead and bought it, and itfs exactly one week before she realizes. The sales girl wonft exchange it. So she writes a letter of complaint. Thatfs the story.  I had to reread your letter three times before I grasped the story. The reason was, your letter was completely different from all the other letters of complaint that come our way. To put it bluntly, there wasnft even any complaint in your letter. Let alone any emotion. The only thing that was there&mdashwas the story.  Really and truly, you had me wondering. Was the letter in fact intended as a complaint or a confession or a proclamation, or was it perhaps meant to put forth some thesis? I had no idea. Your letter reminded me of a news photo from the scene of a massacre. With no commentary, no article, no nothing&mdashjust a photo. A shot of dead bodies littered along some roadside in some country somewhere.  Bang bang bang... therefs your massacre.  No wait, we carn simplify things a little. Simplify them a lot.  That is to say, your letter excites me sexually.  There you have it.   Let us now address the topic of sex.  Thud, thud, thud.  More knocking.  You know, if this doesnft interest you, you can stop the tape. Ifm just talking to myself, blabbering away to the VU meters. Blah, blah, blah.  Okay?   Picture this; short forearms with five fingers, but singularly huge hind legs with four toes, the fourth of which is immensely overdeveloped, while the second and third are extra tiny and fused togetherc thatfs a description of the feet of a kangaroo. Ha ha ha.  Uh, moving on the topic of sex.  Ever since I took your letter home with me, all I can seem to think about is sleeping with you. That Ifll climb into bed to find you next to me, wake up in the morning and there youfd be. As I open my eyes youfll already be getting out of bed, and Ifll hear you zipping up your dress. There Ifd be&mdashand you know how delicate a zipper on a dress can be&mdashwell, Ifd just shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep. I wouldnft even set eye on you.  Once you cut across the room and disappear into the washroom, only then would I open my eyes. Then Ifd get a bite to eat and head out to work.  In the pitch black of night&mdashIfll install special blinds on my windows to make the place extra pitch black&mdashof course I wouldnft see your face. Ifd know nothing, not your age or weight. So I wouldnft lay a hand on you either.  But, well, thatfs fine.  If you realty want to know, it makes no difference whatsoever if I have sex with you or not.  cNo. I take that back.  Let me think that one over.   Okay, letfs put it this way. I would like to sleep with you. But itfs alright if I donft sleep with you. What Ifm saying is Ifd like to be as fair as possible. I donft want to force anything on anybody, any more than Ifd want anything forced on me. Itfs enough that I feel your presence or see your commas swirling around me.  You see, itfs like this.  Sometimes when I think about entities&mdashlike in gseparate entitiesh&mdashit gets mighty grim. I start thinking, and I nearly go to pieces.  cFor instance, say youfre riding on the subway. And there are dozens of people in the car. Mere gpassengersh youfd have to call them, as a rule. gPassengersh being conveyed from Aoyama 1-chome to Akasakamitsuke. Sometimes, though, itfll strike you, that each and every one of those passengers is a distinct individual entity. Like, what does this one do? Or why on earth do you suppose that onefs riding the Ginza Line? Or whatever. By then itfs too late. You let it get to you and youfre a goner.  Looks like that businessmanfs hairline is receding, or the girl over therefs got such hairy legs I bet she shaves at least once a week, or why is that young guy sitting across the aisle wearing that awful color tie? Little things like that. Until finally youfve got the shakes and you want to jump out of the car then and there. Why just the other day&mdashI know youfre going to laugh, but&mdashI was on the verge of pressing the emergency brake button by the door.  I admit it. But that doesnft mean you should go thinking Ifm hypersensitive or on edge all the time. Ifm really a regular sort of guy, your everyday ordinary work-a-day type, gainfully employed in the product control section of a department store. And Ifve got nothing against the subway.  Nor do I have any problem sexually. Therefs a woman Ifm seeing&mdashI guess you could call her my girlfriend&mdashbeen sleeping with her twice a week for maybe a year now. And she and I, wefre both pretty satisfied. Only I try not to take her too seriously. I have no intention of marrying her. If I thought about getting married, Ifm sure Ifd begin taking her seriously, and Ifd lose all confidence that I could carry on from that point. I mean thatfs how it is. You live with a girl and these things start to get to you&mdashher teeth arenft exactly straight, the shape of her fingernails&mdashhow can you expect to go on like that?   Let me say a little more about myself.  No knocking this time.  If youfve listened this far, you might as well hear me out.  Just a second. I need a smoke.  Rattle, rattle.  cUp to now Ifve hardly said a word about myself. Like, therefs really not that much to say. And even if I did, probably nobody would find it terribly interesting.  So why am I telling you all this?  I think I already told you, itfs because now my sights are set on the Nobility of Imperfection.  And what touched off this Nobility of Imperfection idea?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Yes, kangaroos.  Kangaroos are such fascinating creatures, I can look at them for hours on end. What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and thatfs it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If shefs not pregnant, shefs nursing babies, if shefs not nursing babies, shefs pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldnft survive if there werenft any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasnft to go on existing, kangaroos wouldnft be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But Ifm getting ahead of myself. Excuse me.  To talk about myself, then.  Actually, Ifm extremely dissatisfied with being who I am. Itfs nothing to do with my looks or abilities or status or any of that. It simply has to do with being me. The situation strikes me as grossly unfair.  Still, that doesnft mean you should write me off as someone with a lot of gripes. I have not one complaint about the place where I work or my salary. The work is undeniably boring, but then most jobs are boring. Money it not a major issue here.  Shall I put it on the line?  I want to be able to be in two places at once. That is my one and only wish. Other than that, therefs not a thing I desire.  Yet being who and what I am, my singularity hampers this desire of mine. An unhappy lot, donft you think? My wish, if anything, is rather unassuming. I donft want to be ruler of the world, nor do I want to be an artist of genius. I merely want to exist in two places simultaneously. Got itf Not three, not four, only two. I want to be roller skating while Ifm listening to an orchestra at a concert hall. I want to be a MacDonaldfs Quarter-Pounder and still be a clerk in the product control section of the department store. I want to sleep with you and be sleeping with my girlfriend all the while. I went to lead a general existence and yet be a distinct, separate entity.  Allow me one more cigarette.  Whoah.  Getting a little tired.  Ifm not used to this, speaking so frankly about myself.  Therefs just one thing Ifd like to get clear, though. Which is that do not lust after you sexually as a woman. Like I told you, I am angry at the fact that I am only myself and nothing else. This being a solitary entity is dreadfully depressing. Hence I do not seek to sleep with you, a solitary individual.  If, however, you were to divide in two, and I split into two as well, and we four all shared the same bed together, wouldnft that be something! Donft you think?  Please send no reply. If you decide you want to write sue a letter, please send it ease of the company in the form of a complaint. If not a complaint, then whatever you come up with.  Thatfs about it.   I listened to the tape this far on playback just now. To be honest, Ifm very dissatisfied with it. I feel like an aquarium trainer whofs let a seal die out of negligence. It made me worry whether I should even send you this tape or not, blowing this thing all out of proportion even by my standards.  And now that Ifve decided to send it, Ifm still worried.  But what the hell, Ifm striving for imperfection. So Ifve got to live happily by my choice. It was you and the four kangaroos who got me into this imperfection after all.  Signing off.\n     geovisit();    ',NULL),(472,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:11b1d80:fe30184be2:-7fff','2004-08-05 13:56:48',1,'THE KANGAROO COMMUNIQUÉ by MURAKAMI Haruki translated by J. Philip Gabriel  \n  Hi, how are you?  This morning 1 went to a zoo in the neighborhood to see the kangaroos. Itfs not a very big zoo, but somehow theyfve managed to gather together most every kind of animal&mdashEverything from gorillas to elephants. But if what youfre afterfs a llama or an anteater, then youfd better not go there. There arenft any llamas or anteaters. No impalas or hyenas either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, theyfve got four kangaroos.  One is a baby, born just two months ago. And therefs one male and two females. I have no idea what kind of family organization they have.  Every time I look at a kangaroo I always find it strange to think of what itfd be like to be one of them. What are they jumping all around a silly place like Australia for? And why are they killed by such an awkward sort of stick as a boomerang?  I really donft know.  But, well&mdashit doesnft really matter. Itfs no big deal.   At any rate, while I was watching the kangaroos I found myself wanting to send you a letter.  You might think this a little weird. gWhy did you want to send me a letter after watching kangaroos? What do kangaroos have to do with me?h youfll ask. But please donft worry about that. It doesnft matter. Kangaroos are kangaroos and you are you.  What I mean is this.  There are 36 subtle steps between the kangaroos and you, and when I followed them one by one in the correct order, I arrived at where you are. Thatfs all there is to it. Even if I tried to explain all of these steps to you one at a time, I donft think youfd understand and besides I donft even remember them.  eCause therefre 36 of them!  If the order of any one of them had gotten messed up, I wouldnft have been sending you this letter. Instead I might have all of a sudden decided to jump on the back of a sperm whale in the Arctic Ocean. Or I might have set fire to the neighborhood tobacco shop.  Guided by this stack of 36 coincidences, though, here I am sending you a letter.  Itfs all very strange.   O.K., let me begin by introducing myself.   Ifm 26, and work in the merchandise control section of a department store. This is&mdashas I think you can easily imagine&mdasha terribly boring job. First, we check the merchandise purchased by the stock department to see if therefre any defects. We do this to make sure no cozy relationship builds up between that department and the wholesalers, but itfs all done kind of half-heartedly. We sit around shooting the breeze, pulling at shoe buckles, or taking bites out of cakes, just things like that. This is what they mean by merchandise control.  And one more job, actually our main one, is to answer complaints we get from customers about our merchandise. For instance, two pairs of new stockings both got runs in them, or a wind-up toy bear fell off a table and wonft work anymore, or a bathrobe shrank by a quarter in the washing machine. Those type of complaints.  Well, you might not be aware of it, but the number of these complaints is depressingly large. Therefre so many that four employees, running around all day, canft keep up with them. Some complaints seem justified, and some are outrageous. And some are hard to place in either group.  For conveniencefs sake we divide them into three ranks, A, B, and C. In the middle of the room are three large boxes labelled A, B, and C, and we throw the letters into them. We call it the eThree-Step Critique of Reason.h Of course this is an in-joke at the office. Please donft let it bother you.  Anyway, the three ranks are as follows:  A. Reasonable complaints. Cases in which our company must take responsibility. We take a gift box of sweets to the customerfs house, and exchange the merchandise for something appropriate.  B. Cases in which our company is not to blame, either morally, legally, or according to standard business practice. In order not to damage the stores reputation, and to avoid any unnecessary trouble, however, we take the appropriate action.  C. Cases in which it is clearly the customer at fault. We explain the situation and request that they withdraw their complaint.   Now, concerning your complaint we received the other day, after careful examination, we ye arrived at the conclusion that itfs the type that should be ranked C. The reason why is&mdashall right? Please listen carefully&mdash  1. The record that you bought 2. especially after a week has passed 3. without a receipt, cannot be exchanged. No matter where you went in the world you couldnft exchange it. Do you understand what Ifm saying?   This ends my official explanation.  Your complaint has been rejected.  However, if one distances oneself from the official position-something Ifm always doing-my personal reaction to your complaint-that you mistakenly bought Brahms instead of Mahler-is one of sincere sympathy. This isnft a lie. And that is precisely why instead of a perfunctory office memo, Ifm sending you this kind of, in a certain sense, intimate message.  To tell you the truth, all week Ifve tried over and over to write you a letter.  Ifm very sorry, but according to standard business practices, we canft exchange your record. But something in your letter touched me, and personally, blab blab blab.... That kind of letter. But I never could write it well. Itfs not that Ifm poor at writing, itfs just that when I decided to write, the words wouldnft come. The words that did come were not to the point. Itfs a strange thing.  So I decided not to reply. If Ifm going to send you an incomplete letter, itfd be better not to send anything. Donft you think so? I do. An imperfect message is like a mixed-up train schedule.  But this morning, in front of the kangaroofs fence, I experienced the accumulation of 36 coincidences and had a revelation. What this was, in other words, was an enormous incompleteness.  What, you might ask, is an enormous incompleteness?-and well you might ask. An enormous incompleteness, well, to put it simply, might be something like someone in effect ending up forgiving someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, and you forgive me-this kind of thing, for example.  Hmmm.  This kind of cycle, however, is not permanent; someday the kangaroo might not want to forgive you. But donft get angry at the kangaroo just because of this. Itfs not the kangaroofs fault or your own. And itfs not my fault. The kangaroo, too, has very complicated reasons for this. Who could ever criticize a kangaroo?  To grab hold of the instant is all we are able to do. To grab hold of the instant and take a souvenir photograph. In the front row from the left, you, the kangaroo, and me.  I gave up trying to write it down. No matter what I did it wouldnft come out right. For instance, if I write the word gcoincidence,h what you feel from the shape of this written word might be completely different-or even the opposite-of what I feel from the same shape. I think this is very unfair. Ifve stripped to my undershorts, but youfve only undone three buttons of your blouse. Itfs really unfair.  So I bought a cassette tape, and decided to record the letter to you directly.  (Whistling. Eight bars of gThe Colonel Bogey March.h)   Howfs that? Can you hear me?  I donft know how youfll feel when you receive this letter-I mean tape. I canft even imagine. Maybe youfll feel very uneasy about it. Because-because in response to a letter of complaint from a customer the head of merchandise control records his reply on a cassette-and itfs a personal message-and sends it, a highly irregular, and depending on your viewpoint, really stupid thing to do. If it does make you uneasy, and you send this tape back to my boss, itfd put me in a terribly delicate position at the office.  If youfd like to do so, please go ahead.  If that happened, I wouldnft be angry or hate you. You see, wefre on a 1000/0 equal footing. That is, I have the right to send you a letter, and you have the right to put my means of making a living in jeopardy.  Thatfs right, isnft it.  We are equal. Please just remember that.   Oh, right, I forgot to tell you something. Ifve named this letter the gKangaroo Communique.h  Everything needs a name.  Letfs say youfre keeping a diary. Instead of writing something long like gToday an answer to my complaint came from the chief of merchandise control at the department store,h you can just write gToday the eKangaroo Communiquef came.h And itfs a wonderful name, donft you think? From far across the broad plain, a kangaroo with mail in its pouch comes hopping your way.  Rap rap rap. (The sound of a table being hit.)  This is a knock.  Knock knock knock... do you see?  If you donft want to open the door, you donft have to. Either way is all right. If you donft want to listen anymore, please stop the tape and throw it in the garbage can. I just want to sit outside your door and talk by myself for a little while, thatfs all. I have no idea whether youfre listening to me or not. If I have no idea, then it doesnft really matter whether you listen or not, does it? Ha ha ha.   OK&mdashanyhow letfs do it.  Incompleteness, though, is quite troublesome. I didnft think talking in front of a mike like this without any script or plan would be so hard. I feel just like I was standing in the middle of a desert sprinkling water around with a cup. Therefs nothing to see and no response.  So Ifve started talking toward the needle on the VU meter. You know what a VU meter is, donft you? Itfs that thing with the needle that shakes and oscillates according to the volume. I donft know what the V and the U stand for. But even so, they are the only presences that show a response to my speech.  Well...  By the way, they have a simple set of values.  In other words, V and U.  This V and U are like, well, a comedy team. If not V, then U, if not U, then V. What a wonderful world. It makes no difference to them what I talk about. All theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air tremble. Thatfs all. For them, because the air is trembling, I exist.  Isnft that great?  When I look at them, I feel like saying anything, just to keep on talking.  Sigh...  That reminds me. The other day I saw a really sad movie. It was about a comedian that no one laughed at, no matter how many jokes he told.  You understand? Not a single person laughed.  Talking in front of this mike like I am now, I suddenly If remembered that movie.  Itfs a strange thing.  The same lines spoken by one person are screamingly funny, but spoken by someone else are not funny at all. Strange, isnft it? I thought about it, and felt that maybe the difference is somehow inborn. I mean, you know, the tips of their semi-circular canals are curved a little more than other people, something like that.  Sometimes I think about how happy Ifd be to have that ability. Things I always find funny that have me rolling on the floor, once I tell them to others are not a bit interesting and are surprisingly boring. I feel like Ifve become the Sandman of Egypt. And first of all...  Do you know about the Sandman of Egypt?  You see, uhc the Sandman of Egypt was born the prince of Egypt. A long time ago, the age when there were the pyramids and the sphinx and all. But since he had such an ugly face-a really terribly ugly face-the king shunned him and abandoned him deep in the jungle. And what happened next was he was raised by wolves or apes. Not so unusual. And then for some reason he becomes the Sandman. Whatever the Sandman touches changes into sand. Breezes change to sandstorms, brooks become streams of sand, and plains turn into deserts. Thatfs the story of the Sandman. Heard of it? You havenft, right? Thatfs because I made it up. Ha ha ha.  Anyhow, talking to you this way makes me feel like this become the Sandman. Everything I touch turns to sand, sand, sand, sand, sand, sand.   cSomehow Ifve talked too much about myself But if you think about it, it canft be helped. eCause I donft know anything about you. All I know about you is your name and address, thatfs it. I have no idea how old you are, how much you make a year, what shape your nose is, whether youfre fat or thin, married or not. But those are not important. It might even be better that I donft know. I want to handle everything simply, as simply as possible, in a word, metaphysically.  What I mean is, I have your letter here.  Thatfs enough for me.  Just like a zoologist who can calculate from droppings hefs collected in the jungle an elephantfs diet, behavioral patterns, weight, and sex life, based on one letter I can feel the existence of a person&mdashyou. Of course facial features, brand of perfume, etc., those kind of useless things are left out. Existence-itself.  Your letter was really quite captivating. The style, handwriting, punctuation, paragraphing, rhetoric-everything was flawless. Not outstanding. Just flawless.  Every month I read over 500 letters, but honestly this is the first time Ifve ever read one so moving. I snuck your letter home, and read it over and over. Then I analyzed it thoroughly. Since it was a short letter, this wasnft much trouble.  I found out a lot through analyzing it. First of all, the overwhelming number of commas. For every period there were 6.36 commas. A lot, donft you think? Thatfs not all. The way the commas were used really went against all rules.  Please donft think Ifm making fun of your writing. Because I am simply moved.  Moved.  Not just by the punctuation. All the elements of your letter&mdasheven the single ink stain&mdasharoused and shook me.  Why?  Because, in the final analysis, in those sentences you are nowhere to be found. Of course therefs a story. A girl&mdashor a woman&mdashbought the wrong record. Though she had the feeling that the wrong pieces were on it, it was a week before she realized shefd bought the wrong record. The sales clerk wouldnft exchange it for her. So she wrote a letter of complaint. This is the story.  I had to read your letter three times before I understood that story. Because your letter was completely different from the other letters sent to us. To put it plainly, therefs not even a complaint in your letter. No emotion either. The only thing that is present is&mdashthe story.  To tell you the truth, I was a little worried. I couldnft figure out if your letter was meant to be a complaint, a confession, a declaration, or whether it was the establishment of a kind of thesis. Your letter made me think of a news photograph of a massacre. No caption, no article, just a photograph. A photograph taken in some nameless country beside some unknown road, of corpses strewn about.  I canft even figure out what it is you want. Your letter is like the jumbled complexity of a makeshift ant hill, giving no clue as to where to begin. A marvelous thing.  Bang bang bangc a massacre.  Thatfs right, letfs simplify things further. Make them very very simple.  What I mean is, your letter uplifts me sexually.  Thatfs what I mean.   Ifd like to talk about sex.  Knock knock knock.  A knock.  If you arenft interested, please stop the tape. Ifll talk to the VU meter by myself. Blab blab blab.  OK?   The front legs are short and have five toes, while the remarkably large hind legs have four. Just the fourth toe is fully developed. The second and third toes are quite small and are fused.  ... This is a description of a kangaroofs feet. Ha ha ha.  Well then, about sex.   Ever since I took your letter home, all Ifve been thinking about is sleeping with you. In bed with you beside me, when I wake up in the morning youfre still there. When I wake up youfre already up and I can hear the sound of a dress being zipped. But Il... hey, do you know therefs nothing that breaks as easily as the zipper on a dress?c I keep my eyes closed and pretend to be asleep. I canft see you. And you walk across the room and disappear into the bathroom. Then finally I open my eyes. I eat and go to work.  The night is pitch black-Ifve put up special blinds on the window to make it that way-and of course I canft see your face. I donft know your age or weight, or anything. So I canft touch your body with my hand.  But, wellc thatfs all right.  To tell the truth, itfs all right whether I have sex with you or not.  cNo, it isnft.  Let me think for a minute.   OK&mdashthis is what I mean. I want to sleep with you. But itfs OK if we donft. What I mean is I want to be in as fair a position as possible. I donft want to force people to do anything or have them force me. Itfs enough to feel your presence beside me, to have your punctuation marks running around and around me.  Do you understand me?  What I mean is this.  Sometimes itfs very trying for me to think about the individual. A soon as I do my body feels like itfs about to be broken into pieces.  Take, for instance, when Ifm riding on a train. Therefre several dozen people riding on the train. In principle these are merely gpassengers.h gPassengersh carried from Aoyama Itchome to Akasaka Mitsuke. But sometimes I get to feeling very uneasy about the presence of each passenger. What could this person be, what could that person be, why is he riding on the Ginza Line? And then itfs too much. Once I start to feel uneasy therefs no end to it. That office workerfs starting to go bald on both sides of his forehead, isnft he... the hair on that girlfs shins is a little thick, wonder if she shaves once a weekc why is that young guy sitting over there wearing that tie whose color clashes?clike that. And finally my body starts trembling all over and I want to leap from the train. The other day&mdashyoufll probably laugh&mdashI was on the verge of pushing the emergency brake button beside the door.  But just because Ifve told you this, donft get the idea that I am particularly sensitive or nervous. I am not overly sensitive or nervous. Ifm a very ordinary, everyday office worker, the kind you see everyday, who works in the merchandise control section of a department store. And I like the subways.  And itfs not that I have any sexual problems either. I have a girlfriend, and since about a year ago wefve been sleeping together twice a week, an arrangement we re both pretty satisfied with. But Ifve been trying very hard not to think too deeply about her. I donft feel like marrying, either. If we got married, Ifm sure Ifd start to think deeply about her, and I have absolutely no confidence wefd be able to get along once that started. Thatfs the way it is, isnft it? If you worry about the way the teeth of the girl youfre living with are aligned, or the shape of her nails, it wonft work out.   Please let me talk a little more about myself.  This time without any knocks.  If youfve listened this far, please listen all the way to the end.  Just a moment. Ifm going to have a cigarette.  (Rustle rustle)  ...Up till now Ifve hardly ever said a thing about myself to anyone. eCause therefs nothing much to talk about. Even if I did, probably no one would be interested.  So why am 1 talking to you this way?  Itfs because, like I said before, right now I am aiming at an enormous incompleteness.  What was it that touched off this huge incompleteness?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Kangaroos.  Kangaroos are fascinating animals, and I never get tired of looking at them, no matter how many hours I watch. What are they thinking about? They jump meaninglessly round their enclosure all day, and occasionally dig holes in the ground. And what do they do with these holes theyfve dug? Nothing. They just dig holes. Ha ha ha.  A kangaroo gives birth to just one baby at a time. So a female kangaroo gets pregnant as soon as shefs given birth. If it werenft that way they couldnft maintain their numbers. A female kangaroo, then, spends nearly her whole life in pregnancy and raising young. If she isnft pregnant, shefs raising them, if not raising them, then pregnant. So you can say that kangaroos exist to make kangaroos continue to exist. Without the existence of kangaroos, they wouldnft continue to exist, and without the goal of continuing the existence of kangaroos, kangaroos themselves wouldnft exist.  Itfs a strange thing, isnft it.   Ifm sorry the order of what Ifve said has gotten all mixed up.  Ifll talk about myself.  Actually, Ifm extremely frustrated by having to be myself. Not by my looks or ability or position. Just by my being myself. I feel itfs extremely unfair.  Now please donft get the idea from this that I am a very frustrated person. Ifve never once complained about my job or salary. Sure, my job is pointless, but so arc most jobs. And moneyfs not a big problem.  Let me be more precise.  I want to be in two places at once. This is my one and only desire. Besides this I have no other desires.  But this separate entity known as me gets in the way of this desire. Donft you think this is a very unhappy fact? This desire of mine is a modest one, I think. Itfs not that I want to be the leader of the world or an artistic genius. Or to fly through the air. I just want to exist in two places at once. Not three or four, you understand, just two. While listening to an orchestra in a concert hall, I want to roller-skate. While being the head of a department storefs merchandise control, I want to also be a McDonaldfs Quarter Pounder. While sleeping with my girlfriend, I want to be sleeping with you. While being an individual, I also want to be a universal.   Let me have another cigarette.  Sigh...  Ifm a little tired.  Ifm not used to this, talking so honestly about myself.  One thing I want to affirm: I donft have any sexual desire towards you, a woman. As I said before, I am very angry at the fact that I can only be myself. Being a single individual makes me terribly unhappy. I canft stand odd numbers. So I donft want to sleep with you as you the individual.   How wonderful itfd be if you could be split in two, and I could be split in two, and those four people could share a bed. Donft you agree?   Please donft send a reply. If you want to send me a letter, send a letter or complaint in care of the company. If you donft have any complaint to make, think of something.  Well, thatfs all.   I just played the tape back up to this point. To tell you the truth, Ifm not satisfied with it at all. I feel like the guy in charge of feeding animals at the aquarium who lets a sea lion die by mistake. I worried quite a lot about whether this tapefs something I should send to you or not.  Even now that Ifve decided to send it, Ifm still worried.  At any rate, Ifve been aspiring to incompleteness, so I guess I should go along with it without any qualms. What supports it all are you and the four kangaroos.   Well, thatfs all. \n     geovisit();    ',NULL),(473,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:177fa9a:fe301dbd60:-8000','2004-08-05 14:02:29',1,'The Kangaroo Communiqué By MURAKAMI Haruki Translated by Alfred Birnbaum\n Say hey, howfs tricks?  This morning I paid a call on the kangaroos at the local zoo. Not your biggest zoo, but itfs got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, donft go out of your way. You wonft find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I canft for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I canft figure it out.  Though, really, thatfs neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind. Kangaroos are kangaroos, you are you.  In other words, itfs like this.  Thirty-six intricate procedural steps, followed one by one in just the right order, led me from the kangaroos to you&mdashthatfs it. To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldnft be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe Ifd have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isnft it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job&mdashas Ifm sure you can easily imagine&mdashis terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there arenft any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually itfs a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, thatfs about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine&mdashthose kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints&mdashthe sheer number&mdashis enough to dampen anyonefs spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, wefve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office wefve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call gTri-level Rationality Evaluation.h In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customersf homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customerfs fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were&mdashready? listen carefully!&mdashwe cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet Ifm saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside&mdashand actually I leave it aside a lot&mdashmy personal reaction to your plight&mdashhaving mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms&mdashis one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And itfs not although Ifm no good at writing letters. Itfs just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least thatfs what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask&mdashwho wouldnft ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me&mdashto cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please donft get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. Itfs not the kangaroosf fault and itfs not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. Thatfs all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. Itfs going nowhere. Say I write the word gcoincidenceh. What you read in the word gcoincidenceh could be utterly different&mdasheven opposite&mdashfrom what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while youfve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.  (Whistling&mdasheight bars of Colonel Bogiefs March)  Testing, can you hear me?  I donft really know how you will take to receiving this letter&mdashthat is, this tape&mdashI really canft imagine. I suppose you might even get quite upset by it all. Why?c because itfs highly unusual for a product control clerk of a department store to reply to a customer complaint by cassette tape&mdashwith a personalized message, too, mind you!&mdashyou could even, if you were so inclined, say the whole thing was downright bizarre. And say, were you to get so upset that you sent this tape back to my boss, my standing within the organization would be placed in a terribly delicate balance indeed.  But if that is what you want to do please do so.  If it comes to that, I will not get mad or hold grudge against you.  Clear enough? We are on 100% equal term: I have the right to send you a letter and you have the right to threaten my livelihood.  Isnft that right?  Wefre even-steven. Just remember that.  Come to think of it, I forgot to mention that Ifm calling this letter The Kangaroo Communiqué.  I mean, everything needs a name, right?  Suppose, for instance, you keep a diary. Instead of writing this tong, drawn out entry. gDepartment store product control clerkfs reply re. complaint arrives,h you could simply write gKangaroo Communiqué arrivesh and be done with it. And such a catchy name, too, donft you think? The Kangaroo Communiqué: makes you think of kangaroos bounding off across the vast plains, pouches stuffed full of mail. Doesnft it?  Thump, thump, thump (rapping on tabletop).  Now for some knocking.  Knock, knockc Stop me if youfve heard this.  Donft open the door if you donft feel like it. Either way is perfectly fine. If you donft want to listen any more, please stop the tape and throw it away. I just wanted to sit down a while by your front door talking to myself, thatfs all. I have no idea whatsoever if youfre listening or not, but since I donft know, itfs really all the same whether you do or you donft, isnft it? Ha, ha, ha.  Okay, what the hell, letfs give it a go.  Still and all, this imperfection business is pretty tough going. Whofd have thought talking into a microphone without any script or plan would be so hard? Itfs like standing in the middle of the desert sprinkling water around with a cup. No visible sign of anything, not one thing to cling to.  Thatfs why all this time Ifve been talking to the VU meters. You know, the VU meters? Those gizmos with the needles that twitch to the volume. I donft know what the V or the U stand for, but whatever, theyfre the only thing showing any reaction to my ranting.  Hey hey.  All the same, their criteria are really quite simple.  V and U, well, theyfre like a vaudeville duo. Therefs no V without U and no U without V&mdasha nice little set up. As far as theyfre concerned it really doesnft matter what I babble on about. The only thing theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air vibrate. To them, the air vibrates therefore I am.  Pretty swift, donft you think?  Watching them, I get to thinking it doesnft matter what I say so long as I keep talking.  Whoah!  Come to think of it, not too long ago I saw a movie. It was about a comedian who just couldnft make anyone laugh no matter what jokes he told. Got the picture? Not one soul would laugh.  Well, talking into this microphone, Ifm reminded of that movie over and over again.  Itfs all very odd.  Lines spoken by one person will have you dying with laughter, but the very same lines spoken by another wonft seem funny in the least. Curious, donft you think? And the more I think about it, that difference just seems to be one of these things youfre born with. See, itfs like the curvature of the semicircular canals of your cars having the edge over somebody elsefs, or... you know.  Sometimes I find myself thinking, if only I had such gifts, how happy Ifd be. Ifm always doubling over laughing to myself when something funny strikes me, but try to tell someone else and it falls flat, a dud. It makes me feel like the Egyptian Sandman. Even more, itfs...  You know about the Egyptian Sandman?  Hmm, well you see, the Egyptian Sandman was Prince of Egypt by birth. A long time ago, back in the days of pyramids and sphinxes and all that. But because he was so ugly&mdashI mean truly ugly&mdashthe King had him sent off into the deepest jungle to get rid of him. Well, it so happens that the kid ends up getting raised by wolves, or monkeys maybe. One of those stories, you know. And somehow or other he becomes a Sandman. Now this sandman, everything he touches turns to sand. Breezes turn into sandstorm, babbling brooks turn to sand drifts, grassy plains turn to desert. So goes the tale of the Sandman. Ever hear it before? Probably not, eh? Thatfs because I just made it up. Ha, ha, ha.  Anyway, talking to you like this, I get the feeling Ifve become the Egyptian Sandman myself. And what I touch. Itfs sand, sand, sandc  ...Once again. I see Ifm talking about myself too much. But all things considered, itfs unavoidable. I mean, I donft even know one solitary thing about you. Ifve got your address and your name, and thatfs it. Your age, income bracket, the shape of your nose, whether youfre slender or overweight, married or not&mdashwhat do I know? Not that any of that really matters. Itfs almost better this way. If at all possible I prefer to keep things simple, very simple, on the metaphysical level if you will.  To wit, here I have your letter.  This is all I need.  Just as the zoologist collects shit samples in the jungle from which to deduce the elephantfs dietary habits and patterns of activity and weight and sex life, so your one latter gives me enough to go on. I can actually sense what makes up your person. Of course, minus your looks, the kind of perfume you wear, details like that. Nonetheless&mdashyour very essence.  Your letter was honestly quite fascinating. Your choice of words, the handwriting, punctuation, spacing between lines, rhetoric, everything was perfect. Superlative, it was not. But perfect, yes.  Every month I read over five hundred letters, and frankly yours was the first letter that ever moved me. I secretly took your letter home with me and read it over and over again. Then I analyzed your letter thoroughly. Being such a short letter, it was no trouble at all.  Many things came to light through my analysis. First of all, the number of punctuation marks is overwhelming. 6.36 commas for every period. On the high side, donft you think? And thatfs not all: the way you punctuate is markedly irregular.  Listen, please donft think Ifm putting down your writing. Ifm simply moved by it.  Enthralled.  And itfs not just the commas either. Every part of your letter&mdashdown to each ink smear&mdasheverything set me off, everything shook me.  Why?  Well the long and the short of it is, therefs no you in the whole piece of writing. Oh, therefs a story to it alright. A girl&mdasha woman&mdashmakes a mistake buying a record. She had the feeling the record had the wrong tunes, but still she went ahead and bought it, and itfs exactly one week before she realizes. The sales girl wonft exchange it. So she writes a letter of complaint. Thatfs the story.  I had to reread your letter three times before I grasped the story. The reason was, your letter was completely different from all the other letters of complaint that come our way. To put it bluntly, there wasnft even any complaint in your letter. Let alone any emotion. The only thing that was there&mdashwas the story.  Really and truly, you had me wondering. Was the letter in fact intended as a complaint or a confession or a proclamation, or was it perhaps meant to put forth some thesis? I had no idea. Your letter reminded me of a news photo from the scene of a massacre. With no commentary, no article, no nothing&mdashjust a photo. A shot of dead bodies littered along some roadside in some country somewhere.  Bang bang bang... therefs your massacre.  No wait, we carn simplify things a little. Simplify them a lot.  That is to say, your letter excites me sexually.  There you have it.   Let us now address the topic of sex.  Thud, thud, thud.  More knocking.  You know, if this doesnft interest you, you can stop the tape. Ifm just talking to myself, blabbering away to the VU meters. Blah, blah, blah.  Okay?   Picture this; short forearms with five fingers, but singularly huge hind legs with four toes, the fourth of which is immensely overdeveloped, while the second and third are extra tiny and fused togetherc thatfs a description of the feet of a kangaroo. Ha ha ha.  Uh, moving on the topic of sex.  Ever since I took your letter home with me, all I can seem to think about is sleeping with you. That Ifll climb into bed to find you next to me, wake up in the morning and there youfd be. As I open my eyes youfll already be getting out of bed, and Ifll hear you zipping up your dress. There Ifd be&mdashand you know how delicate a zipper on a dress can be&mdashwell, Ifd just shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep. I wouldnft even set eye on you.  Once you cut across the room and disappear into the washroom, only then would I open my eyes. Then Ifd get a bite to eat and head out to work.  In the pitch black of night&mdashIfll install special blinds on my windows to make the place extra pitch black&mdashof course I wouldnft see your face. Ifd know nothing, not your age or weight. So I wouldnft lay a hand on you either.  But, well, thatfs fine.  If you realty want to know, it makes no difference whatsoever if I have sex with you or not.  cNo. I take that back.  Let me think that one over.   Okay, letfs put it this way. I would like to sleep with you. But itfs alright if I donft sleep with you. What Ifm saying is Ifd like to be as fair as possible. I donft want to force anything on anybody, any more than Ifd want anything forced on me. Itfs enough that I feel your presence or see your commas swirling around me.  You see, itfs like this.  Sometimes when I think about entities&mdashlike in gseparate entitiesh&mdashit gets mighty grim. I start thinking, and I nearly go to pieces.  cFor instance, say youfre riding on the subway. And there are dozens of people in the car. Mere gpassengersh youfd have to call them, as a rule. gPassengersh being conveyed from Aoyama 1-chome to Akasakamitsuke. Sometimes, though, itfll strike you, that each and every one of those passengers is a distinct individual entity. Like, what does this one do? Or why on earth do you suppose that onefs riding the Ginza Line? Or whatever. By then itfs too late. You let it get to you and youfre a goner.  Looks like that businessmanfs hairline is receding, or the girl over therefs got such hairy legs I bet she shaves at least once a week, or why is that young guy sitting across the aisle wearing that awful color tie? Little things like that. Until finally youfve got the shakes and you want to jump out of the car then and there. Why just the other day&mdashI know youfre going to laugh, but&mdashI was on the verge of pressing the emergency brake button by the door.  I admit it. But that doesnft mean you should go thinking Ifm hypersensitive or on edge all the time. Ifm really a regular sort of guy, your everyday ordinary work-a-day type, gainfully employed in the product control section of a department store. And Ifve got nothing against the subway.  Nor do I have any problem sexually. Therefs a woman Ifm seeing&mdashI guess you could call her my girlfriend&mdashbeen sleeping with her twice a week for maybe a year now. And she and I, wefre both pretty satisfied. Only I try not to take her too seriously. I have no intention of marrying her. If I thought about getting married, Ifm sure Ifd begin taking her seriously, and Ifd lose all confidence that I could carry on from that point. I mean thatfs how it is. You live with a girl and these things start to get to you&mdashher teeth arenft exactly straight, the shape of her fingernails&mdashhow can you expect to go on like that?   Let me say a little more about myself.  No knocking this time.  If youfve listened this far, you might as well hear me out.  Just a second. I need a smoke.  Rattle, rattle.  cUp to now Ifve hardly said a word about myself. Like, therefs really not that much to say. And even if I did, probably nobody would find it terribly interesting.  So why am I telling you all this?  I think I already told you, itfs because now my sights are set on the Nobility of Imperfection.  And what touched off this Nobility of Imperfection idea?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Yes, kangaroos.  Kangaroos are such fascinating creatures, I can look at them for hours on end. What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and thatfs it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If shefs not pregnant, shefs nursing babies, if shefs not nursing babies, shefs pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldnft survive if there werenft any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasnft to go on existing, kangaroos wouldnft be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But Ifm getting ahead of myself. Excuse me.  To talk about myself, then.  Actually, Ifm extremely dissatisfied with being who I am. Itfs nothing to do with my looks or abilities or status or any of that. It simply has to do with being me. The situation strikes me as grossly unfair.  Still, that doesnft mean you should write me off as someone with a lot of gripes. I have not one complaint about the place where I work or my salary. The work is undeniably boring, but then most jobs are boring. Money it not a major issue here.  Shall I put it on the line?  I want to be able to be in two places at once. That is my one and only wish. Other than that, therefs not a thing I desire.  Yet being who and what I am, my singularity hampers this desire of mine. An unhappy lot, donft you think? My wish, if anything, is rather unassuming. I donft want to be ruler of the world, nor do I want to be an artist of genius. I merely want to exist in two places simultaneously. Got itf Not three, not four, only two. I want to be roller skating while Ifm listening to an orchestra at a concert hall. I want to be a MacDonaldfs Quarter-Pounder and still be a clerk in the product control section of the department store. I want to sleep with you and be sleeping with my girlfriend all the while. I went to lead a general existence and yet be a distinct, separate entity.  Allow me one more cigarette.  Whoah.  Getting a little tired.  Ifm not used to this, speaking so frankly about myself.  Therefs just one thing Ifd like to get clear, though. Which is that do not lust after you sexually as a woman. Like I told you, I am angry at the fact that I am only myself and nothing else. This being a solitary entity is dreadfully depressing. Hence I do not seek to sleep with you, a solitary individual.  If, however, you were to divide in two, and I split into two as well, and we four all shared the same bed together, wouldnft that be something! Donft you think?  Please send no reply. If you decide you want to write sue a letter, please send it ease of the company in the form of a complaint. If not a complaint, then whatever you come up with.  Thatfs about it.   I listened to the tape this far on playback just now. To be honest, Ifm very dissatisfied with it. I feel like an aquarium trainer whofs let a seal die out of negligence. It made me worry whether I should even send you this tape or not, blowing this thing all out of proportion even by my standards.  And now that Ifve decided to send it, Ifm still worried.  But what the hell, Ifm striving for imperfection. So Ifve got to live happily by my choice. It was you and the four kangaroos who got me into this imperfection after all.  Signing off.\n     geovisit();    ',NULL),(474,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:177fa9a:fe301dbd60:-7fff','2004-08-05 14:02:44',1,'THE KANGAROO COMMUNIQUÉ by MURAKAMI Haruki translated by J. Philip Gabriel  \n  Hi, how are you?  This morning 1 went to a zoo in the neighborhood to see the kangaroos. Itfs not a very big zoo, but somehow theyfve managed to gather together most every kind of animal&mdashEverything from gorillas to elephants. But if what youfre afterfs a llama or an anteater, then youfd better not go there. There arenft any llamas or anteaters. No impalas or hyenas either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, theyfve got four kangaroos.  One is a baby, born just two months ago. And therefs one male and two females. I have no idea what kind of family organization they have.  Every time I look at a kangaroo I always find it strange to think of what itfd be like to be one of them. What are they jumping all around a silly place like Australia for? And why are they killed by such an awkward sort of stick as a boomerang?  I really donft know.  But, well&mdashit doesnft really matter. Itfs no big deal.   At any rate, while I was watching the kangaroos I found myself wanting to send you a letter.  You might think this a little weird. gWhy did you want to send me a letter after watching kangaroos? What do kangaroos have to do with me?h youfll ask. But please donft worry about that. It doesnft matter. Kangaroos are kangaroos and you are you.  What I mean is this.  There are 36 subtle steps between the kangaroos and you, and when I followed them one by one in the correct order, I arrived at where you are. Thatfs all there is to it. Even if I tried to explain all of these steps to you one at a time, I donft think youfd understand and besides I donft even remember them.  eCause therefre 36 of them!  If the order of any one of them had gotten messed up, I wouldnft have been sending you this letter. Instead I might have all of a sudden decided to jump on the back of a sperm whale in the Arctic Ocean. Or I might have set fire to the neighborhood tobacco shop.  Guided by this stack of 36 coincidences, though, here I am sending you a letter.  Itfs all very strange.   O.K., let me begin by introducing myself.   Ifm 26, and work in the merchandise control section of a department store. This is&mdashas I think you can easily imagine&mdasha terribly boring job. First, we check the merchandise purchased by the stock department to see if therefre any defects. We do this to make sure no cozy relationship builds up between that department and the wholesalers, but itfs all done kind of half-heartedly. We sit around shooting the breeze, pulling at shoe buckles, or taking bites out of cakes, just things like that. This is what they mean by merchandise control.  And one more job, actually our main one, is to answer complaints we get from customers about our merchandise. For instance, two pairs of new stockings both got runs in them, or a wind-up toy bear fell off a table and wonft work anymore, or a bathrobe shrank by a quarter in the washing machine. Those type of complaints.  Well, you might not be aware of it, but the number of these complaints is depressingly large. Therefre so many that four employees, running around all day, canft keep up with them. Some complaints seem justified, and some are outrageous. And some are hard to place in either group.  For conveniencefs sake we divide them into three ranks, A, B, and C. In the middle of the room are three large boxes labelled A, B, and C, and we throw the letters into them. We call it the eThree-Step Critique of Reason.h Of course this is an in-joke at the office. Please donft let it bother you.  Anyway, the three ranks are as follows:  A. Reasonable complaints. Cases in which our company must take responsibility. We take a gift box of sweets to the customerfs house, and exchange the merchandise for something appropriate.  B. Cases in which our company is not to blame, either morally, legally, or according to standard business practice. In order not to damage the stores reputation, and to avoid any unnecessary trouble, however, we take the appropriate action.  C. Cases in which it is clearly the customer at fault. We explain the situation and request that they withdraw their complaint.   Now, concerning your complaint we received the other day, after careful examination, we ye arrived at the conclusion that itfs the type that should be ranked C. The reason why is&mdashall right? Please listen carefully&mdash  1. The record that you bought 2. especially after a week has passed 3. without a receipt, cannot be exchanged. No matter where you went in the world you couldnft exchange it. Do you understand what Ifm saying?   This ends my official explanation.  Your complaint has been rejected.  However, if one distances oneself from the official position-something Ifm always doing-my personal reaction to your complaint-that you mistakenly bought Brahms instead of Mahler-is one of sincere sympathy. This isnft a lie. And that is precisely why instead of a perfunctory office memo, Ifm sending you this kind of, in a certain sense, intimate message.  To tell you the truth, all week Ifve tried over and over to write you a letter.  Ifm very sorry, but according to standard business practices, we canft exchange your record. But something in your letter touched me, and personally, blab blab blab.... That kind of letter. But I never could write it well. Itfs not that Ifm poor at writing, itfs just that when I decided to write, the words wouldnft come. The words that did come were not to the point. Itfs a strange thing.  So I decided not to reply. If Ifm going to send you an incomplete letter, itfd be better not to send anything. Donft you think so? I do. An imperfect message is like a mixed-up train schedule.  But this morning, in front of the kangaroofs fence, I experienced the accumulation of 36 coincidences and had a revelation. What this was, in other words, was an enormous incompleteness.  What, you might ask, is an enormous incompleteness?-and well you might ask. An enormous incompleteness, well, to put it simply, might be something like someone in effect ending up forgiving someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, and you forgive me-this kind of thing, for example.  Hmmm.  This kind of cycle, however, is not permanent; someday the kangaroo might not want to forgive you. But donft get angry at the kangaroo just because of this. Itfs not the kangaroofs fault or your own. And itfs not my fault. The kangaroo, too, has very complicated reasons for this. Who could ever criticize a kangaroo?  To grab hold of the instant is all we are able to do. To grab hold of the instant and take a souvenir photograph. In the front row from the left, you, the kangaroo, and me.  I gave up trying to write it down. No matter what I did it wouldnft come out right. For instance, if I write the word gcoincidence,h what you feel from the shape of this written word might be completely different-or even the opposite-of what I feel from the same shape. I think this is very unfair. Ifve stripped to my undershorts, but youfve only undone three buttons of your blouse. Itfs really unfair.  So I bought a cassette tape, and decided to record the letter to you directly.  (Whistling. Eight bars of gThe Colonel Bogey March.h)   Howfs that? Can you hear me?  I donft know how youfll feel when you receive this letter-I mean tape. I canft even imagine. Maybe youfll feel very uneasy about it. Because-because in response to a letter of complaint from a customer the head of merchandise control records his reply on a cassette-and itfs a personal message-and sends it, a highly irregular, and depending on your viewpoint, really stupid thing to do. If it does make you uneasy, and you send this tape back to my boss, itfd put me in a terribly delicate position at the office.  If youfd like to do so, please go ahead.  If that happened, I wouldnft be angry or hate you. You see, wefre on a 1000/0 equal footing. That is, I have the right to send you a letter, and you have the right to put my means of making a living in jeopardy.  Thatfs right, isnft it.  We are equal. Please just remember that.   Oh, right, I forgot to tell you something. Ifve named this letter the gKangaroo Communique.h  Everything needs a name.  Letfs say youfre keeping a diary. Instead of writing something long like gToday an answer to my complaint came from the chief of merchandise control at the department store,h you can just write gToday the eKangaroo Communiquef came.h And itfs a wonderful name, donft you think? From far across the broad plain, a kangaroo with mail in its pouch comes hopping your way.  Rap rap rap. (The sound of a table being hit.)  This is a knock.  Knock knock knock... do you see?  If you donft want to open the door, you donft have to. Either way is all right. If you donft want to listen anymore, please stop the tape and throw it in the garbage can. I just want to sit outside your door and talk by myself for a little while, thatfs all. I have no idea whether youfre listening to me or not. If I have no idea, then it doesnft really matter whether you listen or not, does it? Ha ha ha.   OK&mdashanyhow letfs do it.  Incompleteness, though, is quite troublesome. I didnft think talking in front of a mike like this without any script or plan would be so hard. I feel just like I was standing in the middle of a desert sprinkling water around with a cup. Therefs nothing to see and no response.  So Ifve started talking toward the needle on the VU meter. You know what a VU meter is, donft you? Itfs that thing with the needle that shakes and oscillates according to the volume. I donft know what the V and the U stand for. But even so, they are the only presences that show a response to my speech.  Well...  By the way, they have a simple set of values.  In other words, V and U.  This V and U are like, well, a comedy team. If not V, then U, if not U, then V. What a wonderful world. It makes no difference to them what I talk about. All theyfre interested in is how much my voice makes the air tremble. Thatfs all. For them, because the air is trembling, I exist.  Isnft that great?  When I look at them, I feel like saying anything, just to keep on talking.  Sigh...  That reminds me. The other day I saw a really sad movie. It was about a comedian that no one laughed at, no matter how many jokes he told.  You understand? Not a single person laughed.  Talking in front of this mike like I am now, I suddenly If remembered that movie.  Itfs a strange thing.  The same lines spoken by one person are screamingly funny, but spoken by someone else are not funny at all. Strange, isnft it? I thought about it, and felt that maybe the difference is somehow inborn. I mean, you know, the tips of their semi-circular canals are curved a little more than other people, something like that.  Sometimes I think about how happy Ifd be to have that ability. Things I always find funny that have me rolling on the floor, once I tell them to others are not a bit interesting and are surprisingly boring. I feel like Ifve become the Sandman of Egypt. And first of all...  Do you know about the Sandman of Egypt?  You see, uhc the Sandman of Egypt was born the prince of Egypt. A long time ago, the age when there were the pyramids and the sphinx and all. But since he had such an ugly face-a really terribly ugly face-the king shunned him and abandoned him deep in the jungle. And what happened next was he was raised by wolves or apes. Not so unusual. And then for some reason he becomes the Sandman. Whatever the Sandman touches changes into sand. Breezes change to sandstorms, brooks become streams of sand, and plains turn into deserts. Thatfs the story of the Sandman. Heard of it? You havenft, right? Thatfs because I made it up. Ha ha ha.  Anyhow, talking to you this way makes me feel like this become the Sandman. Everything I touch turns to sand, sand, sand, sand, sand, sand.   cSomehow Ifve talked too much about myself But if you think about it, it canft be helped. eCause I donft know anything about you. All I know about you is your name and address, thatfs it. I have no idea how old you are, how much you make a year, what shape your nose is, whether youfre fat or thin, married or not. But those are not important. It might even be better that I donft know. I want to handle everything simply, as simply as possible, in a word, metaphysically.  What I mean is, I have your letter here.  Thatfs enough for me.  Just like a zoologist who can calculate from droppings hefs collected in the jungle an elephantfs diet, behavioral patterns, weight, and sex life, based on one letter I can feel the existence of a person&mdashyou. Of course facial features, brand of perfume, etc., those kind of useless things are left out. Existence-itself.  Your letter was really quite captivating. The style, handwriting, punctuation, paragraphing, rhetoric-everything was flawless. Not outstanding. Just flawless.  Every month I read over 500 letters, but honestly this is the first time Ifve ever read one so moving. I snuck your letter home, and read it over and over. Then I analyzed it thoroughly. Since it was a short letter, this wasnft much trouble.  I found out a lot through analyzing it. First of all, the overwhelming number of commas. For every period there were 6.36 commas. A lot, donft you think? Thatfs not all. The way the commas were used really went against all rules.  Please donft think Ifm making fun of your writing. Because I am simply moved.  Moved.  Not just by the punctuation. All the elements of your letter&mdasheven the single ink stain&mdasharoused and shook me.  Why?  Because, in the final analysis, in those sentences you are nowhere to be found. Of course therefs a story. A girl&mdashor a woman&mdashbought the wrong record. Though she had the feeling that the wrong pieces were on it, it was a week before she realized shefd bought the wrong record. The sales clerk wouldnft exchange it for her. So she wrote a letter of complaint. This is the story.  I had to read your letter three times before I understood that story. Because your letter was completely different from the other letters sent to us. To put it plainly, therefs not even a complaint in your letter. No emotion either. The only thing that is present is&mdashthe story.  To tell you the truth, I was a little worried. I couldnft figure out if your letter was meant to be a complaint, a confession, a declaration, or whether it was the establishment of a kind of thesis. Your letter made me think of a news photograph of a massacre. No caption, no article, just a photograph. A photograph taken in some nameless country beside some unknown road, of corpses strewn about.  I canft even figure out what it is you want. Your letter is like the jumbled complexity of a makeshift ant hill, giving no clue as to where to begin. A marvelous thing.  Bang bang bangc a massacre.  Thatfs right, letfs simplify things further. Make them very very simple.  What I mean is, your letter uplifts me sexually.  Thatfs what I mean.   Ifd like to talk about sex.  Knock knock knock.  A knock.  If you arenft interested, please stop the tape. Ifll talk to the VU meter by myself. Blab blab blab.  OK?   The front legs are short and have five toes, while the remarkably large hind legs have four. Just the fourth toe is fully developed. The second and third toes are quite small and are fused.  ... This is a description of a kangaroofs feet. Ha ha ha.  Well then, about sex.   Ever since I took your letter home, all Ifve been thinking about is sleeping with you. In bed with you beside me, when I wake up in the morning youfre still there. When I wake up youfre already up and I can hear the sound of a dress being zipped. But Il... hey, do you know therefs nothing that breaks as easily as the zipper on a dress?c I keep my eyes closed and pretend to be asleep. I canft see you. And you walk across the room and disappear into the bathroom. Then finally I open my eyes. I eat and go to work.  The night is pitch black-Ifve put up special blinds on the window to make it that way-and of course I canft see your face. I donft know your age or weight, or anything. So I canft touch your body with my hand.  But, wellc thatfs all right.  To tell the truth, itfs all right whether I have sex with you or not.  cNo, it isnft.  Let me think for a minute.   OK&mdashthis is what I mean. I want to sleep with you. But itfs OK if we donft. What I mean is I want to be in as fair a position as possible. I donft want to force people to do anything or have them force me. Itfs enough to feel your presence beside me, to have your punctuation marks running around and around me.  Do you understand me?  What I mean is this.  Sometimes itfs very trying for me to think about the individual. A soon as I do my body feels like itfs about to be broken into pieces.  Take, for instance, when Ifm riding on a train. Therefre several dozen people riding on the train. In principle these are merely gpassengers.h gPassengersh carried from Aoyama Itchome to Akasaka Mitsuke. But sometimes I get to feeling very uneasy about the presence of each passenger. What could this person be, what could that person be, why is he riding on the Ginza Line? And then itfs too much. Once I start to feel uneasy therefs no end to it. That office workerfs starting to go bald on both sides of his forehead, isnft he... the hair on that girlfs shins is a little thick, wonder if she shaves once a weekc why is that young guy sitting over there wearing that tie whose color clashes?clike that. And finally my body starts trembling all over and I want to leap from the train. The other day&mdashyoufll probably laugh&mdashI was on the verge of pushing the emergency brake button beside the door.  But just because Ifve told you this, donft get the idea that I am particularly sensitive or nervous. I am not overly sensitive or nervous. Ifm a very ordinary, everyday office worker, the kind you see everyday, who works in the merchandise control section of a department store. And I like the subways.  And itfs not that I have any sexual problems either. I have a girlfriend, and since about a year ago wefve been sleeping together twice a week, an arrangement we re both pretty satisfied with. But Ifve been trying very hard not to think too deeply about her. I donft feel like marrying, either. If we got married, Ifm sure Ifd start to think deeply about her, and I have absolutely no confidence wefd be able to get along once that started. Thatfs the way it is, isnft it? If you worry about the way the teeth of the girl youfre living with are aligned, or the shape of her nails, it wonft work out.   Please let me talk a little more about myself.  This time without any knocks.  If youfve listened this far, please listen all the way to the end.  Just a moment. Ifm going to have a cigarette.  (Rustle rustle)  ...Up till now Ifve hardly ever said a thing about myself to anyone. eCause therefs nothing much to talk about. Even if I did, probably no one would be interested.  So why am 1 talking to you this way?  Itfs because, like I said before, right now I am aiming at an enormous incompleteness.  What was it that touched off this huge incompleteness?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Kangaroos.  Kangaroos are fascinating animals, and I never get tired of looking at them, no matter how many hours I watch. What are they thinking about? They jump meaninglessly round their enclosure all day, and occasionally dig holes in the ground. And what do they do with these holes theyfve dug? Nothing. They just dig holes. Ha ha ha.  A kangaroo gives birth to just one baby at a time. So a female kangaroo gets pregnant as soon as shefs given birth. If it werenft that way they couldnft maintain their numbers. A female kangaroo, then, spends nearly her whole life in pregnancy and raising young. If she isnft pregnant, shefs raising them, if not raising them, then pregnant. So you can say that kangaroos exist to make kangaroos continue to exist. Without the existence of kangaroos, they wouldnft continue to exist, and without the goal of continuing the existence of kangaroos, kangaroos themselves wouldnft exist.  Itfs a strange thing, isnft it.   Ifm sorry the order of what Ifve said has gotten all mixed up.  Ifll talk about myself.  Actually, Ifm extremely frustrated by having to be myself. Not by my looks or ability or position. Just by my being myself. I feel itfs extremely unfair.  Now please donft get the idea from this that I am a very frustrated person. Ifve never once complained about my job or salary. Sure, my job is pointless, but so arc most jobs. And moneyfs not a big problem.  Let me be more precise.  I want to be in two places at once. This is my one and only desire. Besides this I have no other desires.  But this separate entity known as me gets in the way of this desire. Donft you think this is a very unhappy fact? This desire of mine is a modest one, I think. Itfs not that I want to be the leader of the world or an artistic genius. Or to fly through the air. I just want to exist in two places at once. Not three or four, you understand, just two. While listening to an orchestra in a concert hall, I want to roller-skate. While being the head of a department storefs merchandise control, I want to also be a McDonaldfs Quarter Pounder. While sleeping with my girlfriend, I want to be sleeping with you. While being an individual, I also want to be a universal.   Let me have another cigarette.  Sigh...  Ifm a little tired.  Ifm not used to this, talking so honestly about myself.  One thing I want to affirm: I donft have any sexual desire towards you, a woman. As I said before, I am very angry at the fact that I can only be myself. Being a single individual makes me terribly unhappy. I canft stand odd numbers. So I donft want to sleep with you as you the individual.   How wonderful itfd be if you could be split in two, and I could be split in two, and those four people could share a bed. Donft you agree?   Please donft send a reply. If you want to send me a letter, send a letter or complaint in care of the company. If you donft have any complaint to make, think of something.  Well, thatfs all.   I just played the tape back up to this point. To tell you the truth, Ifm not satisfied with it at all. I feel like the guy in charge of feeding animals at the aquarium who lets a sea lion die by mistake. I worried quite a lot about whether this tapefs something I should send to you or not.  Even now that Ifve decided to send it, Ifm still worried.  At any rate, Ifve been aspiring to incompleteness, so I guess I should go along with it without any qualms. What supports it all are you and the four kangaroos.   Well, thatfs all. \n     geovisit();    ',NULL),(475,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:177fa9a:fe301dbd60:-7ffe','2004-08-05 14:02:59',1,'THE KANGAROO COMMUNIQUÉ by MURAKAMI Haruki translated by J. Philip Gabriel  \n  Hi, how are you?  This morning 1 went to a zoo in the neighborhood to see the kangaroos. It\'s not a very big zoo, but somehow they\'ve managed to gather together most every kind of animal--Everything from gorillas to elephants. But if what you\'re after\'s a llama or an anteater, then you\'d better not go there. There aren\'t any llamas or anteaters. No impalas or hyenas either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, they\'ve got four kangaroos.  One is a baby, born just two months ago. And there\'s one male and two females. I have no idea what kind of family organization they have.  Every time I look at a kangaroo I always find it strange to think of what it\'d be like to be one of them. What are they jumping all around a silly place like Australia for? And why are they killed by such an awkward sort of stick as a boomerang?  I really don\'t know.  But, well--it doesn\'t really matter. It\'s no big deal.   At any rate, while I was watching the kangaroos I found myself wanting to send you a letter.  You might think this a little weird. gWhy did you want to send me a letter after watching kangaroos? What do kangaroos have to do with me?\" you\'ll ask. But please don\'t worry about that. It doesn\'t matter. Kangaroos are kangaroos and you are you.  What I mean is this.  There are 36 subtle steps between the kangaroos and you, and when I followed them one by one in the correct order, I arrived at where you are. That\'s all there is to it. Even if I tried to explain all of these steps to you one at a time, I don\'t think you\'d understand and besides I don\'t even remember them.  \"Cause there\'re 36 of them!  If the order of any one of them had gotten messed up, I wouldn\'t have been sending you this letter. Instead I might have all of a sudden decided to jump on the back of a sperm whale in the Arctic Ocean. Or I might have set fire to the neighborhood tobacco shop.  Guided by this stack of 36 coincidences, though, here I am sending you a letter.  It\'s all very strange.   O.K., let me begin by introducing myself.   I\'m 26, and work in the merchandise control section of a department store. This is--as I think you can easily imagine--a terribly boring job. First, we check the merchandise purchased by the stock department to see if there\'re any defects. We do this to make sure no cozy relationship builds up between that department and the wholesalers, but it\'s all done kind of half-heartedly. We sit around shooting the breeze, pulling at shoe buckles, or taking bites out of cakes, just things like that. This is what they mean by merchandise control.  And one more job, actually our main one, is to answer complaints we get from customers about our merchandise. For instance, two pairs of new stockings both got runs in them, or a wind-up toy bear fell off a table and won\'t work anymore, or a bathrobe shrank by a quarter in the washing machine. Those type of complaints.  Well, you might not be aware of it, but the number of these complaints is depressingly large. There\'re so many that four employees, running around all day, can\'t keep up with them. Some complaints seem justified, and some are outrageous. And some are hard to place in either group.  For convenience\'s sake we divide them into three ranks, A, B, and C. In the middle of the room are three large boxes labelled A, B, and C, and we throw the letters into them. We call it the \"Three-Step Critique of Reason.\" Of course this is an in-joke at the office. Please don\'t let it bother you.  Anyway, the three ranks are as follows:  A. Reasonable complaints. Cases in which our company must take responsibility. We take a gift box of sweets to the customer\'s house, and exchange the merchandise for something appropriate.  B. Cases in which our company is not to blame, either morally, legally, or according to standard business practice. In order not to damage the stores reputation, and to avoid any unnecessary trouble, however, we take the appropriate action.  C. Cases in which it is clearly the customer at fault. We explain the situation and request that they withdraw their complaint.   Now, concerning your complaint we received the other day, after careful examination, we ye arrived at the conclusion that it\'s the type that should be ranked C. The reason why is--all right? Please listen carefully--  1. The record that you bought 2. especially after a week has passed 3. without a receipt, cannot be exchanged. No matter where you went in the world you couldn\'t exchange it. Do you understand what I\'m saying?   This ends my official explanation.  Your complaint has been rejected.  However, if one distances oneself from the official position-something I\'m always doing-my personal reaction to your complaint-that you mistakenly bought Brahms instead of Mahler-is one of sincere sympathy. This isn\'t a lie. And that is precisely why instead of a perfunctory office memo, I\'m sending you this kind of, in a certain sense, intimate message.  To tell you the truth, all week I\'ve tried over and over to write you a letter.  I\'m very sorry, but according to standard business practices, we can\'t exchange your record. But something in your letter touched me, and personally, blab blab blab.... That kind of letter. But I never could write it well. It\'s not that I\'m poor at writing, it\'s just that when I decided to write, the words wouldn\'t come. The words that did come were not to the point. It\'s a strange thing.  So I decided not to reply. If I\'m going to send you an incomplete letter, it\'d be better not to send anything. Don\'t you think so? I do. An imperfect message is like a mixed-up train schedule.  But this morning, in front of the kangaroo\'s fence, I experienced the accumulation of 36 coincidences and had a revelation. What this was, in other words, was an enormous incompleteness.  What, you might ask, is an enormous incompleteness?-and well you might ask. An enormous incompleteness, well, to put it simply, might be something like someone in effect ending up forgiving someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, and you forgive me-this kind of thing, for example.  Hmmm.  This kind of cycle, however, is not permanent; someday the kangaroo might not want to forgive you. But don\'t get angry at the kangaroo just because of this. It\'s not the kangaroo\'s fault or your own. And it\'s not my fault. The kangaroo, too, has very complicated reasons for this. Who could ever criticize a kangaroo?  To grab hold of the instant is all we are able to do. To grab hold of the instant and take a souvenir photograph. In the front row from the left, you, the kangaroo, and me.  I gave up trying to write it down. No matter what I did it wouldn\'t come out right. For instance, if I write the word gcoincidence,\" what you feel from the shape of this written word might be completely different-or even the opposite-of what I feel from the same shape. I think this is very unfair. I\'ve stripped to my undershorts, but you\'ve only undone three buttons of your blouse. It\'s really unfair.  So I bought a cassette tape, and decided to record the letter to you directly.  (Whistling. Eight bars of gThe Colonel Bogey March.\")   How\'s that? Can you hear me?  I don\'t know how you\'ll feel when you receive this letter-I mean tape. I can\'t even imagine. Maybe you\'ll feel very uneasy about it. Because-because in response to a letter of complaint from a customer the head of merchandise control records his reply on a cassette-and it\'s a personal message-and sends it, a highly irregular, and depending on your viewpoint, really stupid thing to do. If it does make you uneasy, and you send this tape back to my boss, it\'d put me in a terribly delicate position at the office.  If you\'d like to do so, please go ahead.  If that happened, I wouldn\'t be angry or hate you. You see, we\'re on a 1000/0 equal footing. That is, I have the right to send you a letter, and you have the right to put my means of making a living in jeopardy.  That\'s right, isn\'t it.  We are equal. Please just remember that.   Oh, right, I forgot to tell you something. I\'ve named this letter the gKangaroo Communique.\"  Everything needs a name.  Let\'s say you\'re keeping a diary. Instead of writing something long like gToday an answer to my complaint came from the chief of merchandise control at the department store,\" you can just write gToday the \"Kangaroo Communique\' came.\" And it\'s a wonderful name, don\'t you think? From far across the broad plain, a kangaroo with mail in its pouch comes hopping your way.  Rap rap rap. (The sound of a table being hit.)  This is a knock.  Knock knock knock... do you see?  If you don\'t want to open the door, you don\'t have to. Either way is all right. If you don\'t want to listen anymore, please stop the tape and throw it in the garbage can. I just want to sit outside your door and talk by myself for a little while, that\'s all. I have no idea whether you\'re listening to me or not. If I have no idea, then it doesn\'t really matter whether you listen or not, does it? Ha ha ha.   OK--anyhow let\'s do it.  Incompleteness, though, is quite troublesome. I didn\'t think talking in front of a mike like this without any script or plan would be so hard. I feel just like I was standing in the middle of a desert sprinkling water around with a cup. There\'s nothing to see and no response.  So I\'ve started talking toward the needle on the VU meter. You know what a VU meter is, don\'t you? It\'s that thing with the needle that shakes and oscillates according to the volume. I don\'t know what the V and the U stand for. But even so, they are the only presences that show a response to my speech.  Well...  By the way, they have a simple set of values.  In other words, V and U.  This V and U are like, well, a comedy team. If not V, then U, if not U, then V. What a wonderful world. It makes no difference to them what I talk about. All they\'re interested in is how much my voice makes the air tremble. That\'s all. For them, because the air is trembling, I exist.  Isn\'t that great?  When I look at them, I feel like saying anything, just to keep on talking.  Sigh...  That reminds me. The other day I saw a really sad movie. It was about a comedian that no one laughed at, no matter how many jokes he told.  You understand? Not a single person laughed.  Talking in front of this mike like I am now, I suddenly If remembered that movie.  It\'s a strange thing.  The same lines spoken by one person are screamingly funny, but spoken by someone else are not funny at all. Strange, isn\'t it? I thought about it, and felt that maybe the difference is somehow inborn. I mean, you know, the tips of their semi-circular canals are curved a little more than other people, something like that.  Sometimes I think about how happy I\'d be to have that ability. Things I always find funny that have me rolling on the floor, once I tell them to others are not a bit interesting and are surprisingly boring. I feel like I\'ve become the Sandman of Egypt. And first of all...  Do you know about the Sandman of Egypt?  You see, uhc the Sandman of Egypt was born the prince of Egypt. A long time ago, the age when there were the pyramids and the sphinx and all. But since he had such an ugly face-a really terribly ugly face-the king shunned him and abandoned him deep in the jungle.

Breezes change to sandstorms, brooks become streams of sand, and plains turn into deserts. That\'s the story of the Sandman. Heard of it? You haven\'t, right? That\'s because I made it up.

I want to handle everything simply, as simply as possible, in a word, metaphysically.  What I mean is, I have your letter here.  That\'s enough for me.  Just like a zoologist who can calculate from droppings he\'s collected in the jungle an elephant\'s diet, behavioral patterns, weight, and sex life, based on one letter I can feel the existence of a person--you.

Even if I did, probably no one would be interested.  So why am 1 talking to you this way?  It\'s because, like I said before, right now I am aiming at an enormous incompleteness.  What was it that touched off this huge incompleteness?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Kangaroos.  Kangaroos are fascinating animals, and I never get tired of looking at them, no matter how many hours I watch. What are they thinking about? They jump meaninglessly round their enclosure all day, and occasionally dig holes in the ground. And what do they do with these holes they\'ve dug? Nothing. They just dig holes. Ha ha ha.  A kangaroo gives birth to just one baby at a time. So a female kangaroo gets pregnant as soon as she\'s given birth. If it weren\'t that way they couldn\'t maintain their numbers. A female kangaroo, then, spends nearly her whole life in pregnancy and raising young. If she isn\'t pregnant, she\'s raising them, if not raising them, then pregnant. So you can say that kangaroos exist to make kangaroos continue to exist. Without the existence of kangaroos, they wouldn\'t continue to exist, and without the goal of continuing the existence of kangaroos, kangaroos themselves wouldn\'t exist.  It\'s a strange thing, isn\'t it.   I\'m sorry the order of what I\'ve said has gotten all mixed up.  I\'ll talk about myself.  Actually, I\'m extremely frustrated by having to be myself. Not by my looks or ability or position. Just by my being myself. I feel it\'s extremely unfair.  Now please don\'t get the idea from this that I am a very frustrated person. I\'ve never once complained about my job or salary. Sure, my job is pointless, but so arc most jobs. And money\'s not a big problem.  Let me be more precise.  I want to be in two places at once. This is my one and only desire. Besides this I have no other desires.  But this separate entity known as me gets in the way of this desire. Don\'t you think this is a very unhappy fact? This desire of mine is a modest one, I think. It\'s not that I want to be the leader of the world or an artistic genius. Or to fly through the air. I just want to exist in two places at once. Not three or four, you understand, just two. While listening to an orchestra in a concert hall, I want to roller-skate. While being the head of a department store\'s merchandise control, I want to also be a McDonald\'s Quarter Pounder. While sleeping with my girlfriend, I want to be sleeping with you. While being an individual, I also want to be a universal.   Let me have another cigarette.  Sigh...  I\'m a little tired.  I\'m not used to this, talking so honestly about myself.  One thing I want to affirm: I don\'t have any sexual desire towards you, a woman. As I said before, I am very angry at the fact that I can only be myself. Being a single individual makes me terribly unhappy. I can\'t stand odd numbers. So I don\'t want to sleep with you as you the individual.   How wonderful it\'d be if you could be split in two, and I could be split in two, and those four people could share a bed. Don\'t you agree?   Please don\'t send a reply. If you want to send me a letter, send a letter or complaint in care of the company. If you don\'t have any complaint to make, think of something.  Well, that\'s all.   I just played the tape back up to this point. To tell you the truth, I\'m not satisfied with it at all. I feel like the guy in charge of feeding animals at the aquarium who lets a sea lion die by mistake. I worried quite a lot about whether this tape\'s something I should send to you or not.  Even now that I\'ve decided to send it, I\'m still worried.  At any rate, I\'ve been aspiring to incompleteness, so I guess I should go along with it without any qualms. What supports it all are you and the four kangaroos.   Well, that\'s all. \n</applet>      geovisit();    ',NULL),(476,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:177fa9a:fe301dbd60:-7ffd','2004-08-05 14:03:12',1,'The Kangaroo Communiqué By MURAKAMI Haruki Translated by Alfred Birnbaum\n Say hey, how\'s tricks?  This morning I paid a call on the kangaroos at the local zoo. Not your biggest zoo, but it\'s got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, don\'t go out of your way. You won\'t find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I can\'t for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I can\'t figure it out.  Though, really, that\'s neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind. Kangaroos are kangaroos, you are you.  In other words, it\'s like this.  Thirty-six intricate procedural steps, followed one by one in just the right order, led me from the kangaroos to you--that\'s it. To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldn\'t be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe I\'d have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isn\'t it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job--as I\'m sure you can easily imagine--is terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there aren\'t any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually it\'s a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, that\'s about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine--those kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints--the sheer number--is enough to dampen anyone\'s spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, we\'ve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office we\'ve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call &ldquoTri-level Rationality Evaluation.&rdquo In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customers\' homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customer\'s fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were--ready? listen carefully!--we cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet I\'m saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside--and actually I leave it aside a lot--my personal reaction to your plight--having mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms--is one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And it\'s not although I\'m no good at writing letters. It\'s just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least that\'s what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask--who wouldn\'t ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me--to cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please don\'t get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. It\'s not the kangaroos\' fault and it\'s not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. That\'s all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. It\'s going nowhere. Say I write the word &ldquocoincidence&rdquo. What you read in the word &ldquocoincidence&rdquo could be utterly different--even opposite--from what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while you\'ve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.  (Whistling--eight bars of Colonel Bogie\'s March)  Testing, can you hear me?  I don\'t really know how you will take to receiving this letter--that is, this tape--I really can\'t imagine. I suppose you might even get quite upset by it all. Why?c because it\'s highly unusual for a product control clerk of a department store to reply to a customer complaint by cassette tape--with a personalized message, too, mind you!--you could even, if you were so inclined, say the whole thing was downright bizarre. And say, were you to get so upset that you sent this tape back to my boss, my standing within the organization would be placed in a terribly delicate balance indeed.  But if that is what you want to do please do so.  If it comes to that, I will not get mad or hold grudge against you.  Clear enough? We are on 100% equal term: I have the right to send you a letter and you have the right to threaten my livelihood.  Isn\'t that right?  We\'re even-steven. Just remember that.  Come to think of it, I forgot to mention that I\'m calling this letter The Kangaroo Communiqué.  I mean, everything needs a name, right?  Suppose, for instance, you keep a diary. Instead of writing this tong, drawn out entry. &ldquoDepartment store product control clerk\'s reply re. complaint arrives,&rdquo you could simply write &ldquoKangaroo Communiqué arrives&rdquo and be done with it. And such a catchy name, too, don\'t you think? The Kangaroo Communiqué: makes you think of kangaroos bounding off across the vast plains, pouches stuffed full of mail. Doesn\'t it?  Thump, thump, thump (rapping on tabletop).  Now for some knocking.  Knock, knockc Stop me if you\'ve heard this.  Don\'t open the door if you don\'t feel like it. Either way is perfectly fine. If you don\'t want to listen any more, please stop the tape and throw it away. I just wanted to sit down a while by your front door talking to myself, that\'s all. I have no idea whatsoever if you\'re listening or not, but since I don\'t know, it\'s really all the same whether you do or you don\'t, isn\'t it? Ha, ha, ha.  Okay, what the hell, let\'s give it a go.  Still and all, this imperfection business is pretty tough going. Who\'d have thought talking into a microphone without any script or plan would be so hard? It\'s like standing in the middle of the desert sprinkling water around with a cup. No visible sign of anything, not one thing to cling to.  That\'s why all this time I\'ve been talking to the VU meters. You know, the VU meters? Those gizmos with the needles that twitch to the volume. I don\'t know what the V or the U stand for, but whatever, they\'re the only thing showing any reaction to my ranting.  Hey hey.  All the same, their criteria are really quite simple.  V and U, well, they\'re like a vaudeville duo. There\'s no V without U and no U without V--a nice little set up. As far as they\'re concerned it really doesn\'t matter what I babble on about. The only thing they\'re interested in is how much my voice makes the air vibrate. To them, the air vibrates therefore I am.  Pretty swift, don\'t you think?  Watching them, I get to thinking it doesn\'t matter what I say so long as I keep talking.  Whoah!  Come to think of it, not too long ago I saw a movie. It was about a comedian who just couldn\'t make anyone laugh no matter what jokes he told. Got the picture? Not one soul would laugh.  Well, talking into this microphone, I\'m reminded of that movie over and over again.  It\'s all very odd.  Lines spoken by one person will have you dying with laughter, but the very same lines spoken by another won\'t seem funny in the least. Curious, don\'t you think? And the more I think about it, that difference just seems to be one of these things you\'re born with. See, it\'s like the curvature of the semicircular canals of your cars having the edge over somebody else\'s, or... you know.  Sometimes I find myself thinking, if only I had such gifts, how happy I\'d be. I\'m always doubling over laughing to myself when something funny strikes me, but try to tell someone else and it falls flat, a dud. It makes me feel like the Egyptian Sandman. Even more, it\'s...  You know about the Egyptian Sandman?  Hmm, well you see, the Egyptian Sandman was Prince of Egypt by birth. A long time ago, back in the days of pyramids and sphinxes and all that. But because he was so ugly--I mean truly ugly--the King had him sent off into the deepest jungle to get rid of him. Well, it so happens that the kid ends up getting raised by wolves, or monkeys maybe. One of those stories, you know. And somehow or other he becomes a Sandman. Now this sandman, everything he touches turns to sand. Breezes turn into sandstorm, babbling brooks turn to sand drifts, grassy plains turn to desert. So goes the tale of the Sandman. Ever hear it before? Probably not, eh? That\'s because I just made it up. Ha, ha, ha.  Anyway, talking to you like this, I get the feeling I\'ve become the Egyptian Sandman myself. And what I touch. It\'s sand, sand, sandc  ...Once again. I see I\'m talking about myself too much. But all things considered, it\'s unavoidable. I mean, I don\'t even know one solitary thing about you. I\'ve got your address and your name, and that\'s it. Your age, income bracket, the shape of your nose, whether you\'re slender or overweight, married or not--what do I know? Not that any of that really matters. It\'s almost better this way. If at all possible I prefer to keep things simple, very simple, on the metaphysical level if you will.  To wit, here I have your letter.  This is all I need.  Just as the zoologist collects shit samples in the jungle from which to deduce the elephant\'s dietary habits and patterns of activity and weight and sex life, so your one latter gives me enough to go on. I can actually sense what makes up your person. Of course, minus your looks, the kind of perfume you wear, details like that. Nonetheless--your very essence.  Your letter was honestly quite fascinating. Your choice of words, the handwriting, punctuation, spacing between lines, rhetoric, everything was perfect. Superlative, it was not. But perfect, yes.  Every month I read over five hundred letters, and frankly yours was the first letter that ever moved me. I secretly took your letter home with me and read it over and over again. Then I analyzed your letter thoroughly. Being such a short letter, it was no trouble at all.  Many things came to light through my analysis. First of all, the number of punctuation marks is overwhelming. 6.36 commas for every period. On the high side, don\'t you think? And that\'s not all: the way you punctuate is markedly irregular.  Listen, please don\'t think I\'m putting down your writing. I\'m simply moved by it.  Enthralled.  And it\'s not just the commas either. Every part of your letter--down to each ink smear--everything set me off, everything shook me.  Why?  Well the long and the short of it is, there\'s no you in the whole piece of writing. Oh, there\'s a story to it alright. A girl--a woman--makes a mistake buying a record. She had the feeling the record had the wrong tunes, but still she went ahead and bought it, and it\'s exactly one week before she realizes. The sales girl won\'t exchange it. So she writes a letter of complaint. That\'s the story.  I had to reread your letter three times before I grasped the story. The reason was, your letter was completely different from all the other letters of complaint that come our way. To put it bluntly, there wasn\'t even any complaint in your letter. Let alone any emotion. The only thing that was there--was the story.  Really and truly, you had me wondering. Was the letter in fact intended as a complaint or a confession or a proclamation, or was it perhaps meant to put forth some thesis? I had no idea. Your letter reminded me of a news photo from the scene of a massacre. With no commentary, no article, no nothing--just a photo. A shot of dead bodies littered along some roadside in some country somewhere.  Bang bang bang... there\'s your massacre.  No wait, we carn simplify things a little. Simplify them a lot.  That is to say, your letter excites me sexually.  There you have it.   Let us now address the topic of sex.  Thud, thud, thud.  More knocking.  You know, if this doesn\'t interest you, you can stop the tape. I\'m just talking to myself, blabbering away to the VU meters. Blah, blah, blah.  Okay?   Picture this; short forearms with five fingers, but singularly huge hind legs with four toes, the fourth of which is immensely overdeveloped, while the second and third are extra tiny and fused togetherc that\'s a description of the feet of a kangaroo. Ha ha ha.  Uh, moving on the topic of sex.  Ever since I took your letter home with me, all I can seem to think about is sleeping with you. That I\'ll climb into bed to find you next to me, wake up in the morning and there you\'d be. As I open my eyes you\'ll already be getting out of bed, and I\'ll hear you zipping up your dress. There I\'d be--and you know how delicate a zipper on a dress can be--well, I\'d just shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep. I wouldn\'t even set eye on you.  Once you cut across the room and disappear into the washroom, only then would I open my eyes. Then I\'d get a bite to eat and head out to work.  In the pitch black of night--I\'ll install special blinds on my windows to make the place extra pitch black--of course I wouldn\'t see your face. I\'d know nothing, not your age or weight. So I wouldn\'t lay a hand on you either.  But, well, that\'s fine.  If you realty want to know, it makes no difference whatsoever if I have sex with you or not.  cNo. I take that back.  Let me think that one over.   Okay, let\'s put it this way. I would like to sleep with you. But it\'s alright if I don\'t sleep with you. What I\'m saying is I\'d like to be as fair as possible. I don\'t want to force anything on anybody, any more than I\'d want anything forced on me. It\'s enough that I feel your presence or see your commas swirling around me.  You see, it\'s like this.  Sometimes when I think about entities--like in &ldquoseparate entities&rdquo--it gets mighty grim. I start thinking, and I nearly go to pieces.  cFor instance, say you\'re riding on the subway. And there are dozens of people in the car. Mere &ldquopassengers&rdquo you\'d have to call them, as a rule. &ldquoPassengers&rdquo being conveyed from Aoyama 1-chome to Akasakamitsuke. Sometimes, though, it\'ll strike you, that each and every one of those passengers is a distinct individual entity. Like, what does this one do? Or why on earth do you suppose that one\'s riding the Ginza Line? Or whatever. By then it\'s too late. You let it get to you and you\'re a goner.  Looks like that businessman\'s hairline is receding, or the girl over there\'s got such hairy legs I bet she shaves at least once a week, or why is that young guy sitting across the aisle wearing that awful color tie? Little things like that. Until finally you\'ve got the shakes and you want to jump out of the car then and there. Why just the other day--I know you\'re going to laugh, but--I was on the verge of pressing the emergency brake button by the door.  I admit it. But that doesn\'t mean you should go thinking I\'m hypersensitive or on edge all the time. I\'m really a regular sort of guy, your everyday ordinary work-a-day type, gainfully employed in the product control section of a department store. And I\'ve got nothing against the subway.  Nor do I have any problem sexually. There\'s a woman I\'m seeing--I guess you could call her my girlfriend--been sleeping with her twice a week for maybe a year now. And she and I, we\'re both pretty satisfied. Only I try not to take her too seriously. I have no intention of marrying her. If I thought about getting married, I\'m sure I\'d begin taking her seriously, and I\'d lose all confidence that I could carry on from that point. I mean that\'s how it is. You live with a girl and these things start to get to you--her teeth aren\'t exactly straight, the shape of her fingernails--how can you expect to go on like that?   Let me say a little more about myself.  No knocking this time.  If you\'ve listened this far, you might as well hear me out.  Just a second. I need a smoke.  Rattle, rattle.  cUp to now I\'ve hardly said a word about myself. Like, there\'s really not that much to say. And even if I did, probably nobody would find it terribly interesting.  So why am I telling you all this?  I think I already told you, it\'s because now my sights are set on the Nobility of Imperfection.  And what touched off this Nobility of Imperfection idea?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Yes, kangaroos.  Kangaroos are such fascinating creatures, I can look at them for hours on end. What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and that\'s it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If she\'s not pregnant, she\'s nursing babies, if she\'s not nursing babies, she\'s pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldn\'t survive if there weren\'t any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasn\'t to go on existing, kangaroos wouldn\'t be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But I\'m getting ahead of myself. Excuse me.  To talk about myself, then.  Actually, I\'m extremely dissatisfied with being who I am. It\'s nothing to do with my looks or abilities or status or any of that. It simply has to do with being me. The situation strikes me as grossly unfair.  Still, that doesn\'t mean you should write me off as someone with a lot of gripes. I have not one complaint about the place where I work or my salary. The work is undeniably boring, but then most jobs are boring. Money it not a major issue here.  Shall I put it on the line?  I want to be able to be in two places at once. That is my one and only wish. Other than that, there\'s not a thing I desire.  Yet being who and what I am, my singularity hampers this desire of mine. An unhappy lot, don\'t you think? My wish, if anything, is rather unassuming. I don\'t want to be ruler of the world, nor do I want to be an artist of genius. I merely want to exist in two places simultaneously. Got it\' Not three, not four, only two. I want to be roller skating while I\'m listening to an orchestra at a concert hall. I want to be a MacDonald\'s Quarter-Pounder and still be a clerk in the product control section of the department store. I want to sleep with you and be sleeping with my girlfriend all the while. I went to lead a general existence and yet be a distinct, separate entity.  Allow me one more cigarette.  Whoah.  Getting a little tired.  I\'m not used to this, speaking so frankly about myself.  There\'s just one thing I\'d like to get clear, though. Which is that do not lust after you sexually as a woman. Like I told you, I am angry at the fact that I am only myself and nothing else. This being a solitary entity is dreadfully depressing. Hence I do not seek to sleep with you, a solitary individual.  If, however, you were to divide in two, and I split into two as well, and we four all shared the same bed together, wouldn\'t that be something! Don\'t you think?  Please send no reply. If you decide you want to write sue a letter, please send it ease of the company in the form of a complaint. If not a complaint, then whatever you come up with.  That\'s about it.   I listened to the tape this far on playback just now. To be honest, I\'m very dissatisfied with it. I feel like an aquarium trainer who\'s let a seal die out of negligence. It made me worry whether I should even send you this tape or not, blowing this thing all out of proportion even by my standards.  And now that I\'ve decided to send it, I\'m still worried.  But what the hell, I\'m striving for imperfection. So I\'ve got to live happily by my choice. It was you and the four kangaroos who got me into this imperfection after all.  Signing off.\n</applet>      geovisit();    ',NULL),(477,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:1eb62b6:fe30250593:-7ffe','2004-08-05 14:13:53',17373,'commas',NULL),(478,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:1eb62b6:fe30250593:-7ffc','2004-08-05 14:14:19',19636,'c',NULL),(479,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:1eb62b6:fe30250593:-7ffa','2004-08-05 14:14:50',23665,'</applet>      geovisit();    ',NULL),(480,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1eb62b6:fe30250593:-7fef','2004-08-05 14:16:17',4614,' Your complaint has been rejected.  However, if one distances oneself from the official position-something I\'m always doing-my personal reaction to your complaint-that you mistakenly bought Brahms instead of Mahler-is one of sincere sympathy. This isn\'t a lie. And that is precisely why instead of a perfunctory office memo, I\'m sending you this kind of, in a certain sense, intimate message.  To tell you the truth, all week I\'ve tried over and over to write you a letter.  I\'m very sorry, but according to standard business practices, we can\'t exchange your record. But something in your letter touched me, and personally, blab blab blab.... That kind of letter. But I never could write it well. It\'s not that I\'m poor at writing, it\'s just that when I decided to write, the words wouldn\'t come. The words that did come were not to the point. It\'s a strange thing.  So I decided not to reply. If I\'m going to send you an incomplete letter, it\'d be better not to send anything. Don\'t you think so? I do. An imperfect message is like a mixed-up train schedule.  But this morning, in front of the kangaroo\'s fence, I experienced the accumulation of 36 coincidences and had a revelation. What this was, in other words, was an enormous incompleteness.  What, you might ask, is an enormous incompleteness?-and well you might ask. An enormous incompleteness, well, to put it simply, might be something like someone in effect ending up forgiving someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, and you forgive me-this kind of thing, for example.  Hmmm.  This kind of cycle, however, is not permanent; someday the kangaroo might not want to forgive you. But don\'t get angry at the kangaroo just because of this. It\'s not the kangaroo\'s fault or your own. And it\'s not my fault. The kangaroo, too, has very complicated reasons for this. Who could ever criticize a kangaroo?  To grab hold of the instant is all we are able to do. To grab hold of the instant and take a souvenir photograph. In the front row from the left, you, the kangaroo, and me.  I gave up trying to write it down. No matter what I did it wouldn\'t come out right. For instance, if I write the word gcoincidence,\" what you feel from the shape of this written word might be completely different-or even the opposite-of what I feel from the same shape. I think this is very unfair. I\'ve stripped to my undershorts, but you\'ve only undone three buttons of your blouse. It\'s really unfair.  So I bought a cassette tape, and decided to record the letter to you directly.  (Whistling. Eight bars of gThe Colonel Bogey March.\")   How\'s that? Can you hear me?  I don\'t know how you\'ll feel when you receive this letter-I mean tape. I can\'t even imagine. Maybe you\'ll feel very uneasy about it. Because-because in response to a letter of complaint from a customer the head of merchandise control records his reply on a cassette-and it\'s a personal message-and sends it, a highly irregular, and depending on your viewpoint, really stupid thing to do. If it does make you uneasy, and you send this tape back to my boss, it\'d put me in a terribly delicate position at the office.  If you\'d like to do so, please go ahead.  If that happened, I wouldn\'t be angry or hate you. You see, we\'re on a 1000/0 equal footing. That is, I have the right to send you a letter, and you have the right to put my means of making a living in jeopardy.  That\'s right, isn\'t it.  We are equal. Please just remember that.   Oh, right, I forgot to tell you something. I\'ve named this letter the gKangaroo Communique.\"  Everything needs a name.  Let\'s say you\'re keeping a diary. Instead of writing something long like gToday an answer to my complaint came from the chief of merchandise control at the department store,\" you can just write gToday the \"Kangaroo Communique\' came.\" And it\'s a wonderful name, don\'t you think? From far across the broad plain, a kangaroo with mail in its pouch comes hopping your way.  Rap rap rap. (The sound of a table being hit.)  This is a knock.  Knock knock knock... do you see?  If you don\'t want to open the door, you don\'t have to. Either way is all right. If you don\'t want to listen anymore, please stop the tape and throw it in the garbage can. I just want to sit outside your door and talk by myself for a little while, that\'s all. I have no idea whether you\'re listening to me or not. If I have no idea, then it doesn\'t really matter whether you listen or not, does it? Ha ha ha.   OK--anyhow let\'s do it.  Incompleteness, though, is quite troublesome. I didn\'t think talking in front of a mike like this without any script or plan would be so hard. I feel just like I was standing in the middle of a desert sprinkling water around with a cup. There\'s nothing to see and no response.  So I\'ve started talking toward the needle on the VU meter. You know what a VU meter is, don\'t you? It\'s that thing with the needle that shakes and oscillates according to the volume. I don\'t know what the V and the U stand for. But even so, they are the only presences that show a response to my speech.  Well...  By the way, they have a simple set of values.  In other words, V and U.  This V and U are like, well, a comedy team. If not V, then U, if not U, then V. What a wonderful world. It makes no difference to them what I talk about. All they\'re interested in is how much my voice makes the air tremble. That\'s all. For them, because the air is trembling, I exist.  Isn\'t that great?  When I look at them, I feel like saying anything, just to keep on talking.  Sigh...  That reminds me. The other day I saw a really sad movie. It was about a comedian that no one laughed at, no matter how many jokes he told.  You understand? Not a single person laughed.  Talking in front of this mike like I am now, I suddenly If remembered that movie.  It\'s a strange thing.  The same lines spoken by one person are screamingly funny, but spoken by someone else are not funny at all. Strange, isn\'t it? I thought about it, and felt that maybe the difference is somehow inborn. I mean, you know, the tips of their semi-circular canals are curved a little more than other people, something like that.  Sometimes I think about how happy I\'d be to have that ability. Things I always find funny that have me rolling on the floor, once I tell them to others are not a bit interesting and are surprisingly boring. I feel like I\'ve become the Sandman of Egypt. And first of all...  Do you know about the Sandman of Egypt?  You see, uhc the Sandman of Egypt was born the prince of Egypt. A long time ago, the age when there were the pyramids and the sphinx and all. But since he had such an ugly face-a really terribly ugly face-the king shunned him and abandoned him deep in the jungle. And what happened next was he was raised by wolves or apes. Not so unusual. And then for some reason he becomes the Sandman. Whatever the Sandman touches changes into sand. Breezes change to sandstorms, brooks become streams of sand, and plains turn into deserts. That\'s the story of the Sandman. Heard of it? You haven\'t, right? That\'s because I made it up. Ha ha ha.  Anyhow, talking to you this way makes me feel like this become the Sandman. Everything I touch turns to sand, sand, sand, sand, sand, sand.   cSomehow I\'ve talked too much about myself But if you think about it, it can\'t be helped. \"Cause I don\'t know anything about you. All I know about you is your name and address, that\'s it. I have no idea how old you are, how much you make a year, what shape your nose is, whether you\'re fat or thin, married or not. But those are not important. It might even be better that I don\'t know. I want to handle everything simply, as simply as possible, in a word, metaphysically.  What I mean is, I have your letter here.  That\'s enough for me.  Just like a zoologist who can calculate from droppings he\'s collected in the jungle an elephant\'s diet, behavioral patterns, weight, and sex life, based on one letter I can feel the existence of a person--you. Of course facial features, brand of perfume, etc., those kind of useless things are left out. Existence-itself.  Your letter was really quite captivating. The style, handwriting, punctuation, paragraphing, rhetoric-everything was flawless. Not outstanding. Just flawless.  Every month I read over 500 letters, but honestly this is the first time I\'ve ever read one so moving. I snuck your letter home, and read it over and over. Then I analyzed it thoroughly. Since it was a short letter, this wasn\'t much trouble.  I found out a lot through analyzing it. First of all, the overwhelming number of commas. For every period there were 6.36 commas. A lot, don\'t you think? That\'s not all. The way the commas were used really went against all rules.  Please don\'t think I\'m making fun of your writing. Because I am simply moved.  Moved.  Not just by the punctuation. All the elements of your letter--even the single ink stain--aroused and shook me.  Why?  Because, in the final analysis, in those sentences you are nowhere to be found. Of course there\'s a story. A girl--or a woman--bought the wrong record. Though she had the feeling that the wrong pieces were on it, it was a week before she realized she\'d bought the wrong record. The sales clerk wouldn\'t exchange it for her. So she wrote a letter of complaint. This is the story.  I had to read your letter three times before I understood that story. Because your letter was completely different from the other letters sent to us. To put it plainly, there\'s not even a complaint in your letter. No emotion either. The only thing that is present is--the story.  To tell you the truth, I was a little worried. I couldn\'t figure out if your letter was meant to be a complaint, a confession, a declaration, or whether it was the establishment of a kind of thesis. Your letter made me think of a news photograph of a massacre. No caption, no article, just a photograph. A photograph taken in some nameless country beside some unknown road, of corpses strewn about.  I can\'t even figure out what it is you want. Your letter is like the jumbled complexity of a makeshift ant hill, giving no clue as to where to begin. A marvelous thing.  Bang bang bangc a massacre.  That\'s right, let\'s simplify things further. Make them very very simple.  What I mean is, your letter uplifts me sexually.  That\'s what I mean.   I\'d like to talk about sex.  Knock knock knock.  A knock.  If you aren\'t interested, please stop the tape. I\'ll talk to the VU meter by myself. Blab blab blab.  OK?   The front legs are short and have five toes, while the remarkably large hind legs have four. Just the fourth toe is fully developed. The second and third toes are quite small and are fused.  ... This is a description of a kangaroo\'s feet. Ha ha ha.  Well then, about sex.   Ever since I took your letter home, all I\'ve been thinking about is sleeping with you. In bed with you beside me, when I wake up in the morning you\'re still there. When I wake up you\'re already up and I can hear the sound of a dress being zipped. But Il... hey, do you know there\'s nothing that breaks as easily as the zipper on a dress?c I keep my eyes closed and pretend to be asleep. I can\'t see you. And you walk across the room and disappear into the bathroom. Then finally I open my eyes. I eat and go to work.  The night is pitch black-I\'ve put up special blinds on the window to make it that way-and of course I can\'t see your face. I don\'t know your age or weight, or anything. So I can\'t touch your body with my hand.  But, wellc that\'s all right.  To tell the truth, it\'s all right whether I have sex with you or not.  cNo, it isn\'t.  Let me think for a minute.   OK--this is what I mean. I want to sleep with you. But it\'s OK if we don\'t. What I mean is I want to be in as fair a position as possible. I don\'t want to force people to do anything or have them force me. It\'s enough to feel your presence beside me, to have your punctuation marks running around and around me.  Do you understand me?  What I mean is this.  Sometimes it\'s very trying for me to think about the individual. A soon as I do my body feels like it\'s about to be broken into pieces.  Take, for instance, when I\'m riding on a train. There\'re several dozen people riding on the train. In principle these are merely gpassengers.\" gPassengers\" carried from Aoyama Itchome to Akasaka Mitsuke. But sometimes I get to feeling very uneasy about the presence of each passenger. What could this person be, what could that person be, why is he riding on the Ginza Line? And then it\'s too much. Once I start to feel uneasy there\'s no end to it. That office worker\'s starting to go bald on both sides of his forehead, isn\'t he... the hair on that girl\'s shins is a little thick, wonder if she shaves once a weekc why is that young guy sitting over there wearing that tie whose color clashes?clike that. And finally my body starts trembling all over and I want to leap from the train. The other day--you\'ll probably laugh--I was on the verge of pushing the emergency brake button beside the door.  But just because I\'ve told you this, don\'t get the idea that I am particularly sensitive or nervous. I am not overly sensitive or nervous. I\'m a very ordinary, everyday office worker, the kind you see everyday, who works in the merchandise control section of a department store. And I like the subways.  And it\'s not that I have any sexual problems either. I have a girlfriend, and since about a year ago we\'ve been sleeping together twice a week, an arrangement we re both pretty satisfied with. But I\'ve been trying very hard not to think too deeply about her. I don\'t feel like marrying, either. If we got married, I\'m sure I\'d start to think deeply about her, and I have absolutely no confidence we\'d be able to get along once that started. That\'s the way it is, isn\'t it? If you worry about the way the teeth of the girl you\'re living with are aligned, or the shape of her nails, it won\'t work out.   Please let me talk a little more about myself.  This time without any knocks.  If you\'ve listened this far, please listen all the way to the end.  Just a moment. I\'m going to have a cigarette.  (Rustle rustle)  ...Up till now I\'ve hardly ever said a thing about myself to anyone. \"Cause there\'s nothing much to talk about. Even if I did, probably no one would be interested.  So why am 1 talking to you this way?  It\'s because, like I said before, right now I am aiming at an enormous incompleteness.  What was it that touched off this huge incompleteness?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Kangaroos.  Kangaroos are fascinating animals, and I never get tired of looking at them, no matter how many hours I watch. What are they thinking about? They jump meaninglessly round their enclosure all day, and occasionally dig holes in the ground. And what do they do with these holes they\'ve dug? Nothing. They just dig holes. Ha ha ha.  A kangaroo gives birth to just one baby at a time. So a female kangaroo gets pregnant as soon as she\'s given birth. If it weren\'t that way they couldn\'t maintain their numbers. A female kangaroo, then, spends nearly her whole life in pregnancy and raising young. If she isn\'t pregnant, she\'s raising them, if not raising them, then pregnant. So you can say that kangaroos exist to make kangaroos continue to exist. Without the existence of kangaroos, they wouldn\'t continue to exist, and without the goal of continuing the existence of kangaroos, kangaroos themselves wouldn\'t exist.  It\'s a strange thing, isn\'t it.   I\'m sorry the order of what I\'ve said has gotten all mixed up.  I\'ll talk about myself.  Actually, I\'m extremely frustrated by having to be myself. Not by my looks or ability or position. Just by my being myself. I feel it\'s extremely unfair.  Now please don\'t get the idea from this that I am a very frustrated person. I\'ve never once complained about my job or salary. Sure, my job is pointless, but so arc most jobs. And money\'s not a big problem.  Let me be more precise.  I want to be in two places at once. This is my one and only desire. Besides this I have no other desires.  But this separate entity known as me gets in the way of this desire. Don\'t you think this is a very unhappy fact? This desire of mine is a modest one, I think. It\'s not that I want to be the leader of the world or an artistic genius. Or to fly through the air. I just want to exist in two places at once. Not three or four, you understand, just two. While listening to an orchestra in a concert hall, I want to roller-skate. While being the head of a department store\'s merchandise control, I want to also be a McDonald\'s Quarter Pounder. While sleeping with my girlfriend, I want to be sleeping with you. While being an individual, I also want to be a universal.   Let me have another cigarette.  Sigh...  I\'m a little tired.  I\'m not used to this, talking so honestly about myself.  One thing I want to affirm: I don\'t have any sexual desire towards you, a woman. As I said before, I am very angry at the fact that I can only be myself. Being a single individual makes me terribly unhappy. I can\'t stand odd numbers. So I don\'t want to sleep with you as you the individual.   How wonderful it\'d be if you could be split in two, and I could be split in two, and those four people could share a bed. Don\'t you agree?',NULL),(481,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1eb62b6:fe30250593:-7fee','2004-08-05 14:16:30',22139,'  I just played the tape back up to this point. To tell you the truth, I\'m not satisfied with it at all. I feel like the guy in charge of feeding animals at the aquarium who lets a sea lion die by mistake. I worried quite a lot about whether this tape\'s something I should send to you or not.  Even now that I\'ve decided to send it, I\'m still worried.  At any rate, I\'ve been aspiring to incompleteness, so I guess I should go along with it without any qualms. What supports it all are you and the four kangaroos.   Well, that\'s all. \n</applet>      geovisit();    ',NULL),(482,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:1eb62b6:fe30250593:-7fec','2004-08-05 14:17:41',4648,'  However, if one distances oneself from the official position-something I\'m always doing-my personal reaction to your complaint-that you mistakenly bought Brahms instead of Mahler-is one of sincere sympathy. This isn\'t a lie. And that is precisely why instead of a perfunctory office memo, I\'m sending you this kind of, in a certain sense, intimate message.  To tell you the truth, all week I\'ve tried over and over to write you a letter.  I\'m very sorry, but according to standard business practices, we can\'t exchange your record. But something in your letter touched me, and personally, blab blab blab.... That kind of letter. But I never could write it well. It\'s not that I\'m poor at writing, it\'s just that when I decided to write, the words wouldn\'t come. The words that did come were not to the point. It\'s a strange thing.  So I decided not to reply. If I\'m going to send you an incomplete letter, it\'d be better not to send anything. Don\'t you think so? I do. An imperfect message is like a mixed-up train schedule.  But this morning, in front of the kangaroo\'s fence, I experienced the accumulation of 36 coincidences and had a revelation. What this was, in other words, was an enormous incompleteness.  What, you might ask, is an enormous incompleteness?-and well you might ask. An enormous incompleteness, well, to put it simply, might be something like someone in effect ending up forgiving someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, and you forgive me-this kind of thing, for example.  Hmmm.  This kind of cycle, however, is not permanent; someday the kangaroo might not want to forgive you. But don\'t get angry at the kangaroo just because of this. It\'s not the kangaroo\'s fault or your own. And it\'s not my fault. The kangaroo, too, has very complicated reasons for this. Who could ever criticize a kangaroo?  To grab hold of the instant is all we are able to do. To grab hold of the instant and take a souvenir photograph. In the front row from the left, you, the kangaroo, and me.  I gave up trying to write it down. No matter what I did it wouldn\'t come out right. For instance, if I write the word gcoincidence,\" what you feel from the shape of this written word might be completely different-or even the opposite-of what I feel from the same shape. I think this is very unfair. I\'ve stripped to my undershorts, but you\'ve only undone three buttons of your blouse. It\'s really unfair.  So I bought a cassette tape, and decided to record the letter to you directly.  (Whistling. Eight bars of gThe Colonel Bogey March.\")   How\'s that? Can you hear me?  I don\'t know how you\'ll feel when you receive this letter-I mean tape. I can\'t even imagine. Maybe you\'ll feel very uneasy about it. Because-because in response to a letter of complaint from a customer the head of merchandise control records his reply on a cassette-and it\'s a personal message-and sends it, a highly irregular, and depending on your viewpoint, really stupid thing to do. If it does make you uneasy, and you send this tape back to my boss, it\'d put me in a terribly delicate position at the office.  If you\'d like to do so, please go ahead.  If that happened, I wouldn\'t be angry or hate you. You see, we\'re on a 1000/0 equal footing. That is, I have the right to send you a letter, and you have the right to put my means of making a living in jeopardy.  That\'s right, isn\'t it.  We are equal. Please just remember that.   Oh, right, I forgot to tell you something. I\'ve named this letter the gKangaroo Communique.\"  Everything needs a name.  Let\'s say you\'re keeping a diary. Instead of writing something long like gToday an answer to my complaint came from the chief of merchandise control at the department store,\" you can just write gToday the \"Kangaroo Communique\' came.\" And it\'s a wonderful name, don\'t you think?

If she isn\'t pregnant, she\'s raising them, if not raising them, then pregnant. So you can say that kangaroos exist to make kangaroos continue to exist. Without the existence of kangaroos, they wouldn\'t continue to exist, and without the goal of continuing the existence of kangaroos, kangaroos themselves wouldn\'t exist.  It\'s a strange thing, isn\'t it.   I\'m sorry the order of what I\'ve said has gotten all mixed up.  I\'ll talk about myself.  Actually, I\'m extremely frustrated by having to be myself. Not by my looks or ability or position. Just by my being myself. I feel it\'s extremely unfair.  Now please don\'t get the idea from this that I am a very frustrated person. I\'ve never once complained about my job or salary. Sure, my job is pointless, but so arc most jobs. And money\'s not a big problem.  Let me be more precise.  I want to be in two places at once. This is my one and only desire. Besides this I have no other desires.  But this separate entity known as me gets in the way of this desire. Don\'t you think this is a very unhappy fact? This desire of mine is a modest one, I think. It\'s not that I want to be the leader of the world or an artistic genius. Or to fly through the air. I just want to exist in two places at once. Not three or four, you understand, just two. While listening to an orchestra in a concert hall, I want to roller-skate. While being the head of a department store\'s merchandise control, I want to also be a McDonald\'s Quarter Pounder. While sleeping with my girlfriend, I want to be sleeping with you. While being an individual, I also want to be a universal.   Let me have another cigarette.  Sigh...  I\'m a little tired.  I\'m not used to this, talking so honestly about myself.  One thing I want to affirm: I don\'t have any sexual desire towards you, a woman. As I said before, I am very angry at the fact that I can only be myself. Being a single individual makes me terribly unhappy. I can\'t stand odd numbers. So I don\'t want to sleep with you as you the individual.   How wonderful it\'d be if you could be split in two, and I could be split in two, and those four people could share a bed. Don\'t you agree?

This isn\'t a lie. And that is precisely why instead of a perfunctory office memo, I\'m sending you this kind of, in a certain sense, intimate message.  To tell you the truth, all week I\'ve tried over and over to write you a letter.  I\'m very sorry, but according to standard business practices, we can\'t exchange your record. But something in your letter touched me, and personally, blab blab blab.... That kind of letter. But I never could write it well. It\'s not that I\'m poor at writing, it\'s just that when I decided to write, the words wouldn\'t come. The words that did come were not to the point. It\'s a strange thing.  So I decided not to reply. If I\'m going to send you an incomplete letter, it\'d be better not to send anything. Don\'t you think so? I do. An imperfect message is like a mixed-up train schedule.  But this morning, in front of the kangaroo\'s fence, I experienced the accumulation of 36 coincidences and had a revelation. What this was, in other words, was an enormous incompleteness.  What, you might ask, is an enormous incompleteness?-and well you might ask. An enormous incompleteness, well, to put it simply, might be something like someone in effect ending up forgiving someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, and you forgive me-this kind of thing, for example.  Hmmm.  This kind of cycle, however, is not permanent; someday the kangaroo might not want to forgive you. But don\'t get angry at the kangaroo just because of this. It\'s not the kangaroo\'s fault or your own. And it\'s not my fault. The kangaroo, too, has very complicated reasons for this. Who could ever criticize a kangaroo?  To grab hold of the instant is all we are able to do. To grab hold of the instant and take a souvenir photograph. In the front row from the left, you, the kangaroo, and me.  I gave up trying to write it down. No matter what I did it wouldn\'t come out right. For instance, if I write the word gcoincidence,\" what you feel from the shape of this written word might be completely different-or even the opposite-of what I feel from the same shape. I think this is very unfair. I\'ve stripped to my undershorts, but you\'ve only undone three buttons of your blouse. It\'s really unfair.  So I bought a cassette tape, and decided to record the letter to you directly.  (Whistling. Eight bars of gThe Colonel Bogey March.\")   How\'s that? Can you hear me?  I don\'t know how you\'ll feel when you receive this letter-I mean tape. I can\'t even imagine. Maybe you\'ll feel very uneasy about it. Because-because in response to a letter of complaint from a customer the head of merchandise control records his reply on a cassette-and it\'s a personal message-and sends it, a highly irregular, and depending on your viewpoint, really stupid thing to do. If it does make you uneasy, and you send this tape back to my boss, it\'d put me in a terribly delicate position at the office.  If you\'d like to do so, please go ahead.  If that happened, I wouldn\'t be angry or hate you. You see, we\'re on a 1000/0 equal footing. That is, I have the right to send you a letter, and you have the right to put my means of making a living in jeopardy.  That\'s right, isn\'t it.  We are equal. Please just remember that.   Oh, right, I forgot to tell you something. I\'ve named this letter the gKangaroo Communique.\"  Everything needs a name.  Let\'s say you\'re keeping a diary. Instead of writing something long like gToday an answer to my complaint came from the chief of merchandise control at the department store,\" you can just write gToday the \"Kangaroo Communique\' came.\" And it\'s a wonderful name, don\'t you think? From far across the broad plain, a kangaroo with mail in its pouch comes hopping your way.  Rap rap rap. (The sound of a table being hit.)  This is a knock.  Knock knock knock... do you see?  If you don\'t want to open the door, you don\'t have to. Either way is all right. If you don\'t want to listen anymore, please stop the tape and throw it in the garbage can. I just want to sit outside your door and talk by myself for a little while, that\'s all. I have no idea whether you\'re listening to me or not. If I have no idea, then it doesn\'t really matter whether you listen or not, does it? Ha ha ha.   OK--anyhow let\'s do it.  Incompleteness, though, is quite troublesome. I didn\'t think talking in front of a mike like this without any script or plan would be so hard. I feel just like I was standing in the middle of a desert sprinkling water around with a cup. There\'s nothing to see and no response.  So I\'ve started talking toward the needle on the VU meter. You know what a VU meter is, don\'t you? It\'s that thing with the needle that shakes and oscillates according to the volume. I don\'t know what the V and the U stand for. But even so, they are the only presences that show a response to my speech.  Well...  By the way, they have a simple set of values.  In other words, V and U.  This V and U are like, well, a comedy team. If not V, then U, if not U, then V. What a wonderful world. It makes no difference to them what I talk about. All they\'re interested in is how much my voice makes the air tremble. That\'s all. For them, because the air is trembling, I exist.  Isn\'t that great?  When I look at them, I feel like saying anything, just to keep on talking.  Sigh...  That reminds me. The other day I saw a really sad movie. It was about a comedian that no one laughed at, no matter how many jokes he told.  You understand? Not a single person laughed.  Talking in front of this mike like I am now, I suddenly If remembered that movie.  It\'s a strange thing.  The same lines spoken by one person are screamingly funny, but spoken by someone else are not funny at all. Strange, isn\'t it? I thought about it, and felt that maybe the difference is somehow inborn. I mean, you know, the tips of their semi-circular canals are curved a little more than other people, something like that.  Sometimes I think about how happy I\'d be to have that ability. Things I always find funny that have me rolling on the floor, once I tell them to others are not a bit interesting and are surprisingly boring. I feel like I\'ve become the Sandman of Egypt. And first of all...  Do you know about the Sandman of Egypt?  You see, uhc the Sandman of Egypt was born the prince of Egypt. A long time ago, the age when there were the pyramids and the sphinx and all. But since he had such an ugly face-a really terribly ugly face-the king shunned him and abandoned him deep in the jungle. And what happened next was he was raised by wolves or apes. Not so unusual. And then for some reason he becomes the Sandman. Whatever the Sandman touches changes into sand. Breezes change to sandstorms, brooks become streams of sand, and plains turn into deserts. That\'s the story of the Sandman. Heard of it? You haven\'t, right? That\'s because I made it up. Ha ha ha.  Anyhow, talking to you this way makes me feel like this become the Sandman. Everything I touch turns to sand, sand, sand, sand, sand, sand.   cSomehow I\'ve talked too much about myself But if you think about it, it can\'t be helped. \"Cause I don\'t know anything about you. All I know about you is your name and address, that\'s it. I have no idea how old you are, how much you make a year, what shape your nose is, whether you\'re fat or thin, married or not. But those are not important. It might even be better that I don\'t know. I want to handle everything simply, as simply as possible, in a word, metaphysically.  What I mean is, I have your letter here.  That\'s enough for me.  Just like a zoologist who can calculate from droppings he\'s collected in the jungle an elephant\'s diet, behavioral patterns, weight, and sex life, based on one letter I can feel the existence of a person--you. Of course facial features, brand of perfume, etc., those kind of useless things are left out. Existence-itself.  Your letter was really quite captivating. The style, handwriting, punctuation, paragraphing, rhetoric-everything was flawless. Not outstanding. Just flawless.  Every month I read over 500 letters, but honestly this is the first time I\'ve ever read one so moving. I snuck your letter home, and read it over and over. Then I analyzed it thoroughly. Since it was a short letter, this wasn\'t much trouble.  I found out a lot through analyzing it. First of all, the overwhelming number of commas. For every period there were 6.36 commas. A lot, don\'t you think? That\'s not all. The way the commas were used really went against all rules.  Please don\'t think I\'m making fun of your writing. Because I am simply moved.  Moved.  Not just by the punctuation. All the elements of your letter--even the single ink stain--aroused and shook me.  Why?  Because, in the final analysis, in those sentences you are nowhere to be found. Of course there\'s a story. A girl--or a woman--bought the wrong record. Though she had the feeling that the wrong pieces were on it, it was a week before she realized she\'d bought the wrong record. The sales clerk wouldn\'t exchange it for her. So she wrote a letter of complaint. This is the story.  I had to read your letter three times before I understood that story. Because your letter was completely different from the other letters sent to us. To put it plainly, there\'s not even a complaint in your letter. No emotion either. The only thing that is present is--the story.  To tell you the truth, I was a little worried. I couldn\'t figure out if your letter was meant to be a complaint, a confession, a declaration, or whether it was the establishment of a kind of thesis. Your letter made me think of a news photograph of a massacre. No caption, no article, just a photograph. A photograph taken in some nameless country beside some unknown road, of corpses strewn about.  I can\'t even figure out what it is you want. Your letter is like the jumbled complexity of a makeshift ant hill, giving no clue as to where to begin. A marvelous thing.  Bang bang bangc a massacre.  That\'s right, let\'s simplify things further. Make them very very simple.  What I mean is, your letter uplifts me sexually.  That\'s what I mean.   I\'d like to talk about sex.  Knock knock knock.  A knock.  If you aren\'t interested, please stop the tape. I\'ll talk to the VU meter by myself. Blab blab blab.  OK?   The front legs are short and have five toes, while the remarkably large hind legs have four. Just the fourth toe is fully developed. The second and third toes are quite small and are fused.  ... This is a description of a kangaroo\'s feet. Ha ha ha.  Well then, about sex.   Ever since I took your letter home, all I\'ve been thinking about is sleeping with you. In bed with you beside me, when I wake up in the morning you\'re still there. When I wake up you\'re already up and I can hear the sound of a dress being zipped. But Il... hey, do you know there\'s nothing that breaks as easily as the zipper on a dress?c I keep my eyes closed and pretend to be asleep. I can\'t see you. And you walk across the room and disappear into the bathroom. Then finally I open my eyes. I eat and go to work.  The night is pitch black-I\'ve put up special blinds on the window to make it that way-and of course I can\'t see your face. I don\'t know your age or weight, or anything. So I can\'t touch your body with my hand.  But, wellc that\'s all right.  To tell the truth, it\'s all right whether I have sex with you or not.  cNo, it isn\'t.  Let me think for a minute.   OK--this is what I mean. I want to sleep with you. But it\'s OK if we don\'t. What I mean is I want to be in as fair a position as possible. I don\'t want to force people to do anything or have them force me. It\'s enough to feel your presence beside me, to have your punctuation marks running around and around me.  Do you understand me?  What I mean is this.  Sometimes it\'s very trying for me to think about the individual. A soon as I do my body feels like it\'s about to be broken into pieces.  Take, for instance, when I\'m riding on a train. There\'re several dozen people riding on the train. In principle these are merely gpassengers.\" gPassengers\" carried from Aoyama Itchome to Akasaka Mitsuke. But sometimes I get to feeling very uneasy about the presence of each passenger. What could this person be, what could that person be, why is he riding on the Ginza Line? And then it\'s too much. Once I start to feel uneasy there\'s no end to it. That office worker\'s starting to go bald on both sides of his forehead, isn\'t he... the hair on that girl\'s shins is a little thick, wonder if she shaves once a weekc why is that young guy sitting over there wearing that tie whose color clashes?clike that. And finally my body starts trembling all over and I want to leap from the train. The other day--you\'ll probably laugh--I was on the verge of pushing the emergency brake button beside the door.  But just because I\'ve told you this, don\'t get the idea that I am particularly sensitive or nervous. I am not overly sensitive or nervous. I\'m a very ordinary, everyday office worker, the kind you see everyday, who works in the merchandise control section of a department store. And I like the subways.  And it\'s not that I have any sexual problems either. I have a girlfriend, and since about a year ago we\'ve been sleeping together twice a week, an arrangement we re both pretty satisfied with. But I\'ve been trying very hard not to think too deeply about her. I don\'t feel like marrying, either. If we got married, I\'m sure I\'d start to think deeply about her, and I have absolutely no confidence we\'d be able to get along once that started. That\'s the way it is, isn\'t it? If you worry about the way the teeth of the girl you\'re living with are aligned, or the shape of her nails, it won\'t work out.   Please let me talk a little more about myself.  This time without any knocks.  If you\'ve listened this far, please listen all the way to the end.  Just a moment. I\'m going to have a cigarette.  (Rustle rustle)  ...Up till now I\'ve hardly ever said a thing about myself to anyone. \"Cause there\'s nothing much to talk about. Even if I did, probably no one would be interested.  So why am 1 talking to you this way?  It\'s because, like I said before, right now I am aiming at an enormous incompleteness.  What was it that touched off this huge incompleteness?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Kangaroos.  Kangaroos are fascinating animals, and I never get tired of looking at them, no matter how many hours I watch. What are they thinking about? They jump meaninglessly round their enclosure all day, and occasionally dig holes in the ground. And what do they do with these holes they\'ve dug? Nothing. They just dig holes. Ha ha ha.  A kangaroo gives birth to just one baby at a time. So a female kangaroo gets pregnant as soon as she\'s given birth. If it weren\'t that way they couldn\'t maintain their numbers. A female kangaroo, then, spends nearly her whole life in pregnancy and raising young. If she isn\'t pregnant, she\'s raising them, if not raising them, then pregnant. So you can say that kangaroos exist to make kangaroos continue to exist.

Mere gpassengersh youfd have to call them, as a rule. gPassengersh being conveyed from Aoyama 1-chome to Akasakamitsuke.

You let it get to you and youfre a goner.  Looks like that businessmanfs hairline is receding, or the girl over therefs got such hairy legs I bet she shaves at least once a week, or why is that young guy sitting across the aisle wearing that awful color tie?

And even if I did, probably nobody would find it terribly interesting.  So why am I telling you all this?  I think I already told you, itfs because now my sights are set on the Nobility of Imperfection.  And what touched off this Nobility of Imperfection idea?  Your letter and four kangaroos.  Yes, kangaroos.  Kangaroos are such fascinating creatures, I can look at them for hours on end. What can kangaroos possibly have to think about? The whole lot of them, jumping around in their cage all day long, digging holes now and again. And then what do they do with these holes? Nothing. They dig them and thatfs it. Ha ha ha.  Kangaroos only give birth to one baby at a time. So as soon as one baby is born, the female gets pregnant again. Otherwise the kangaroo population would never sustain itself. This means the female kangaroo spends her entire life either pregnant or nursing babies. If shefs not pregnant, shefs nursing babies, if shefs not nursing babies, shefs pregnant. You could say she exists just to ensure the continuance of the species. The kangaroo species wouldnft survive if there werenft any kangaroos, and if their purpose wasnft to go on existing, kangaroos wouldnft be around in the first place.  Funny about that.  But Ifm getting ahead of myself. Excuse me.  To talk about myself, then.  Actually, Ifm extremely dissatisfied with being who I am. Itfs nothing to do with my looks or abilities or status or any of that. It simply has to do with being me. The situation strikes me as grossly unfair.  Still, that doesnft mean you should write me off as someone with a lot of gripes. I have not one complaint about the place where I work or my salary. The work is undeniably boring, but then most jobs are boring. Money it not a major issue here.  Shall I put it on the line?  I want to be able to be in two places at once. That is my one and only wish. Other than that, therefs not a thing I desire.  Yet being who and what I am, my singularity hampers this desire of mine. An unhappy lot, donft you think? My wish, if anything, is rather unassuming. I donft want to be ruler of the world, nor do I want to be an artist of genius. I merely want to exist in two places simultaneously. Got itf Not three, not four, only two. I want to be roller skating while Ifm listening to an orchestra at a concert hall. I want to be a MacDonaldfs Quarter-Pounder and still be a clerk in the product control section of the department store. I want to sleep with you and be sleeping with my girlfriend all the while. I went to lead a general existence and yet be a distinct, separate entity.  Allow me one more cigarette.  Whoah.  Getting a little tired.  Ifm not used to this, speaking so frankly about myself.  Therefs just one thing Ifd like to get clear, though. Which is that do not lust after you sexually as a woman. Like I told you, I am angry at the fact that I am only myself and nothing else. This being a solitary entity is dreadfully depressing. Hence I do not seek to sleep with you, a solitary individual.  If, however, you were to divide in two, and I split into two as well, and we four all shared the same bed together, wouldnft that be something!

Ifm always doubling over laughing to myself when something funny strikes me, but try to tell someone else and it falls flat, a dud. It makes me feel like the Egyptian Sandman. Even more, itfs...  You know about the Egyptian Sandman?  Hmm, well you see, the Egyptian Sandman was Prince of Egypt by birth. A long time ago, back in the days of pyramids and sphinxes and all that. But because he was so ugly&mdashI mean truly ugly&mdashthe King had him sent off into the deepest jungle to get rid of him. Well, it so happens that the kid ends up getting raised by wolves, or monkeys maybe. One of those stories, you know. And somehow or other he becomes a Sandman. Now this sandman, everything he touches turns to sand. Breezes turn into sandstorm, babbling brooks turn to sand drifts, grassy plains turn to desert. So goes the tale of the Sandman. Ever hear it before? Probably not, eh? Thatfs because I just made it up. Ha, ha, ha.  Anyway, talking to you like this, I get the feeling Ifve become the Egyptian Sandman myself. And what I touch. Itfs sand, sand, sandc  ...Once again. I see Ifm talking about myself too much. But all things considered, itfs unavoidable. I mean, I donft even know one solitary thing about you. Ifve got your address and your name, and thatfs it. Your age, income bracket, the shape of your nose, whether youfre slender or overweight, married or not&mdashwhat do I know? Not that any of that really matters. Itfs almost better this way. If at all possible I prefer to keep things simple, very simple, on the metaphysical level if you will.  To wit, here I have your letter.  This is all I need.  Just as the zoologist collects shit samples in the jungle from which to deduce the elephantfs dietary habits and patterns of activity and weight and sex life, so your one latter gives me enough to go on. I can actually sense what makes up your person. Of course, minus your looks, the kind of perfume you wear, details like that. Nonetheless&mdashyour very essence.  Your letter was honestly quite fascinating. Your choice of words, the handwriting, punctuation, spacing between lines, rhetoric, everything was perfect. Superlative, it was not. But perfect, yes.  Every month I read over five hundred letters, and frankly yours was the first letter that ever moved me. I secretly took your letter home with me and read it over and over again. Then I analyzed your letter thoroughly. Being such a short letter, it was no trouble at all.  Many things came to light through my analysis. First of all, the number of punctuation marks is overwhelming. 6.36 commas for every period. On the high side, donft you think? And thatfs not all: the way you punctuate is markedly irregular.  Listen, please donft think Ifm putting down your writing.

Not your biggest zoo, but itfs got the standard animals. Everything from gorilla to elephants. Although if your taste runs to llamas and anteaters, donft go out of your way. You wonft find any there. No impala or hyena either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, there are four kangaroos.  One, an infant, born just two months ago. And a male and two females. I canft for the life of me figure out how they get along as a family.  Everytime I set eyes on a kangaroo, it all seems too improbable to me: I mean, what on earth would it feel like to be a kangaroo? For what possible reason do they go hopping around in such an ungodly place as Australia? Just to get killed by some clunky stick of a boomerang?  I canft figure it out.  Though, really, thatfs neither here nor there. No major issue.  Anyway, looking at these kangaroos, I got the urge to send you a letter.  Maybe that strikes you as odd. You ask yourself why should looking at kangaroos make me want to send you a letter? And just what is the connection between these kangaroos and me? Well, you can stop thinking those thoughts right now. Makes no never-mind. Kangaroos are kangaroos, you are you.  In other words, itfs like this.  Thirty-six intricate procedural steps, followed one by one in just the right order, led me from the kangaroos to you&mdashthatfs it. To attempt so explain each and every one of these steps would surely try your powers of comprehension, but more than that, I doubt I can even remember them all.  There were thirty-six of them after all!  If just one of these steps had gotten screwed up, I guess I wouldnft be sending you this letter. Who knows? I might have ended up somewhere in the Antarctic Ocean careening about on the back of a sperm whale. Or maybe Ifd have torched the local cigarette stand.  Yet somehow, guided by this seemingly random convergence of thirty-six coincidences, I find myself communicating with you.  Strange isnft it?   Okay, then, allow me to introduce myself.  I am twenty-six years old and work in the products control section of a department store. The job&mdashas Ifm sure you can easily imagine&mdashis terribly boring. First of all, I check the merchandise the purchasing section has decided to stack, make sure there arenft any problems with the products. This is supposed to prevent collusion between the purchasing section and the suppliers, but actually itfs a pretty loose operation. A few tugs at shoe buckles while chatting, a nibble or two at some sample sweets, thatfs about it. So much for \"product control.\"  Then we come to another task, the real heart of our work, which is responding to customer complaints. Say, for instance, two pairs of stockings just purchased developed runs one after another, or the wind-up bear fell off the table and stopped working, or a bathrobe shrank by one-fourth the first time through the machine&mdashthose kind of complaints.  Well, let me tell you, the number of complaints&mdashthe sheer number&mdashis enough to dampen anyonefs spirits. Enough to keep four staffers racing around like crazy day in and day out. These complaints include both clear-cut cases and totally unreasonable requests. Then there are those we have to puzzle over. For convenience sake, wefve classified these into three categories: A, B, and C. And in the middle of the office wefve got three boxes, marked A, B, and C respectively, where we toss the letters. An operation we call gTri-level Rationality Evaluation.h In-house joke. Forget I mentioned it.  Anyway, to explain these three categories, we have:  (A) Reasonable complaints. Cases where we are obliged to assume responsibility. We visit the customersf homes bearing boxes of sweets and exchange the merchandise in question.  (B) Borderline cases. When in doubt, we play safe. Even where there is no moral obligation or business precedent or legal liability, we offer some appropriate gesture so as to not compromise the image of the department store and to avoid unnecessary trouble.  (C) Customer negligence. When clearly the customerfs fault, we offer an explanation of the situation and leave it at that.  Now, as to your complaints of a few days back, we gave the matter serious consideration and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that your complaint was of a nature that could only be classified as belonging to category C. The reasons for this were&mdashready? listen carefully!&mdashwe cannot exchange (1) a record once purchased (2) one whole week later (3) without a receipt. Nowhere in the world can you do this.  Do you get whet Ifm saying?  End of explanation of situation. Your complaint has been duly processed.   Nonetheless, professional viewpoint aside&mdashand actually I leave it aside a lot&mdashmy personal reaction to your plight&mdashhaving mistakenly bought Mahler, not Brahms&mdashis one of heartfelt sympathy. I kid you not. So it is that I send you, not your run-of-the-mill from letter, but this in some sense more intimate message.   Actually, I started to write you a letter any number of times last week. We regret to inform you that our policy prohibits the exchange of records, although your letter did in some small way move me to personallyc blah, blah, blah. A letter like that. Nothing I wrote, however, came out right. And itfs not although Ifm no good at writing letters. Itfs just that each time I set my mind on writing you, I drew a blank, and the words that did come were consistently off base. Strangest thing.  So I decided not to respond at all. I mean, why send out a botched attempt at a letter? Better to send nothing at all, right? At least thatfs what I think: a message imperfectly communicated does about as much good as a screwed-up timetable.  As fate would have it though, this morning, standing before the kangaroo cage, I hit upon the exact permutation of those thirty-six coincidences and came up with this inspiration. To wit, the principle we shall call the Nobility of Imperfection. Now what is this Nobility of Imperfection, you may ask&mdashwho wouldnft ask? Well, simply put, the Nobility of Imperfection might mean nothing so much as the proposition that someone in effect forgive someone else. I forgive the kangaroos, the kangaroos forgive you, you forgive me&mdashto cite but one example.  Uh huh.  This cycle, however, is not perpetual. At some point the kangaroos might take it into their heads not to forgive you. Please donft get angry at the kangaroos just because of that, though. Itfs not the kangaroosf fault and itfs not your fault. Nor for that matter is it my fault. The kangaroos have their own pressing circumstances. And I ask you, what kind of person is it who can blame a kangaroo?  So we seize the moment. Thatfs all we can do. Capture the moment in a snapshot. Front and center, in a row left to right: you, the kangaroos, me.  Enough of trying to write this all down. Itfs going nowhere. Say I write the word gcoincidenceh. What you read in the word gcoincidenceh could be utterly different&mdasheven opposite&mdashfrom what the very same word means to me. This is unfair, if I may say so. Here I am stripped to my underpants while youfve only undone three button of your blouse. An unfair turn of events if there ever was one.  Hence I bought myself a cassette tape, having decided to directly record my letter to you.',NULL),(499,4,'f16e9ac2d35a9b9a:b81da:fe69135923:-8000','2004-08-16 15:29:20',0,'',NULL),(500,2,'f16e9ac2d35a9b9a:b81da:fe69135923:-7fff','2004-08-16 15:29:47',84,'how are you?  This morning 1 went to a zoo in the neighborhood to see the kangaroos. Itfs not a very big zoo, but somehow theyfve managed to gather together most every kind of animal&mdashEverything from gorillas to elephants. But if what youfre afterfs a llama or an anteater, then youfd better not go there. There arenft any llamas or anteaters. No impalas or hyenas either. Not even a leopard.  Instead, theyfve got four kangaroos.  One is a baby, born just two months ago. And therefs one male and two females. I have no idea what kind of family organization they have.  Every time I look at a kangaroo I always find it strange to think of what itfd be like to be one of them. What are they jumping all around a silly place like Australia for? And why are they killed by such an awkward sort of stick as a boomerang?  I really donft know.  But, well&mdashit doesnft really matter. Itfs no big deal.   At any rate, while I was watching the kangaroos I found myself wanting to send you a letter.  You might think this a little weird. gWhy did you want to send me a letter after watching kangaroos? What do kangaroos have to do with me?h youfll ask. But please donft worry about that. It doesnft matter. Kangaroos are kangaroos and you are you.  What I mean is this.  There are 36 subtle steps between the kangaroos and you, and when I followed them one by one in the correct order, I arrived at where you are. Thatfs all there is to it. Even if I tried to explain all of these steps to you one at a time, I donft think youfd understand and besides I donft even remember them.  eCause therefre 36 of them!  If the order of any one of them had gotten messed up, I wouldnft have been sending you this letter. Instead I might have all of a sudden decided to jump on the back of a sperm whale in the Arctic Ocean. Or I might have set fire to the neighborhood tobacco shop.  Guided by this stack of 36 coincidences, though, here I am sending you a letter.  Itfs all very strange.   O.K., let me begin by introducing myself.   Ifm 26, and work in the merchandise control section of a department store. This is&mdashas I think you can easily imagine&mdasha terribly boring job. First, we check the merchandise purchased by the stock department to see if therefre any defects. We do this to make sure no cozy relationship builds up between that department and the wholesalers, but itfs all done kind of half-heartedly. We sit around shooting the breeze, pulling at shoe buckles, or taking bites out of cakes, just things like that. This is what they mean by merchandise control.  And one more job, actually our main one, is to answer complaints we get from customers about our merchandise. For instance, two pairs of new stockings both got runs in them, or a wind-up toy bear fell off a table and wonft work anymore, or a bathrobe shrank by a quarter in the washing machine. Those type of complaints.  Well, you might not be aware of it, but the number of these complaints is depressingly large. Therefre so many that four employees, running around all day, canft keep up with them. Some complaints seem jus',NULL);
