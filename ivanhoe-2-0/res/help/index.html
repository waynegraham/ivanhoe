      <h3>What is Ivanhoe?<br>
      </h3>
Ivanhoe is a literary game where players engage a version of a text and
modify it, thereby creating a new interpretive instance of the
work.&nbsp; Each player may choose to react to other interpretations
and locate his or her interpretation within the universe of
interpretive possibility.&nbsp; In the context of the game, the
universe of possibility is simply all interpretations by other
players.&nbsp; In the large scheme of things, an Ivanhoe game exists as
a constellation among infinite possible interrelated interpretations.<br>
      <br>
Typical gameplay involves modifying the Declared Edition of the text,
adding new documents, online chat with other players and summarizing
one's move in the forum.&nbsp; A move is composed of one or more
actions, such as addition or deletion.&nbsp; When finished, the move
should, be submitted for other players to see.<br>
