Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites; they can reproduce only by invading and controlling other cells as they lack the cellular machinery for self reproduction. The term virus usually refers to those particles which infect eukaryotes (multi-celled organisms and many single-celled organisms), whilst the term bacteriophage or phage is used to describe those infecting prokaryotes (bacteria and bacteria-like organisms). Typically these particles carry a small amount of nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA, but not both) surrounded by some form of protective coat consisting of proteins, lipids, glycoproteins or a combination. Importantly, viral genomes code not only for the proteins needed to package its genetic material, but for proteins needed by the virus during its life cycle (the term \"life cycle\" used loosely here as viruses are not, as was stated, alive).\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Origins\n    * 2 Size, structure, and anatomy\n    * 3 Replication\n          o 3.1 Outline\n    * 4 Non-living or alive?\n    * 5 Study and applications\n          o 5.1 Exploring basic cellular processes\n          o 5.2 Genetic engineering\n          o 5.3 Materials science and nanotechnology\n    * 6 Human viral diseases\n          o 6.1 Laboratory diagnosis of pathogenic viruses\n          o 6.2 Prevention and treatment of viral diseases\n    * 7 Etymology\n    * 8 See also\n          o 8.1 See also\n    * 9 References\n          o 9.1 Numbered references\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins\n\nThe origin of viruses is not entirely clear, but the currently favoured explanation is that they are derived from their host organisms, originating from transferrable elements like plasmids or transposons. It has also been suggested that they may represent extremely reduced microbes, which appeared separately in the primordial soup that gave rise to the first cells, or that the different sorts of viruses appeared through different mechanisms.\n\nOther infectious particles which are even simpler in structure than viruses include viroids, virusoids, and prions.\n[edit]\n\nSize, structure, and anatomy\n\nVirus particles comprise a nucleic acid genome that may be either DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded, and positive or negative sense. This is surrounded (encapsidated) by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The viral capsid may be either spherical or helical and is composed of proteins encoded by the viral genome. In helical viruses, the capsid protein (frequently called the nucleocapsid protein) binds directly to the viral genome. For example, in the case of the measles virus, one nucleocapsid protein binds every six bases of RNA to form a helix approximately 1.3 micrometers in length. This complex of protein and nucleic acid is called the nucleocapsid, and, in the case of the measles virus, is enclosed in a lipid \"envelope\" acquired from the host cell, in which virus-encoded glycoproteins are embedded. These are responsible for binding to and entering the host cell at the start of a new infection. Spherical virus capsids completely enclose the viral genome and do not generally bind as tightly to the nucleic acid as helical capsid proteins do. These structures can range in size from less than 20 nanometers up to 400 nanometers and are composed of viral proteins arranged with icosahedral symmetry. Icosahedral architecture is the same principle employed by R. Buckminster-Fuller in his geodesic dome, and it is the most efficient way of creating an enclosed robust structure from multiple copies of a single protein. The number of proteins required to form a spherical virus capsid is denoted by the \"T-number\" whereby 60t proteins are necessary. In the case of the hepatitis B virus, the T-number is 4, therefore 240 proteins assemble to form the capsid. As in the helical viruses, the spherical virus capsid may be enclosed in a lipid envelope, although frequently spherical viruses are not enveloped, and the capsid proteins themselves are directly involved in attachment and entry into the host cell. The complete virus particle is referred to as a virion. A virion is little more than a gene transporter, and components of the envelope and capsid provide the mechanism for injecting the viral genome into a host cell[1].\n[edit]\n\nReplication\n\nBecause viruses are acellular and do not have their own metabolism, they must utilize the machinery and metabolism of the host to reproduce. Before a virus has entered a host cell, it is called a virion â€” a package of viral genetic material. Virions can be passed from host to host either through direct contact or through a vector, or carrier. Inside the organism, the virus can enter a cell in various ways. Bacteriophagesâ€”bacterial virusesâ€”attach to the cell wall surface in specific places. Once attached, enzymes make a small hole in the cell wall, and the virus injects its DNA into the cell. Other viruses (such as HIV) enter the host via endocytosis, the process whereby cells take in material from the external environment. After entering the cell, the virus\'s genetic material begins the destructive process of causing the cell to produce new viruses.\n\nThere are three different ways genetic information contained in a viral genome can be reproduced. The form of genetic material contained in the viral capsid, the protein coat that surrounds the nucleic acid, determines the exact replication process.\n\nSome viruses have DNA, which once inside the host cell is replicated by the host along with its own DNA.\n\nThere are two different replication processes for viruses containing RNA. In the first process, the viral RNA is directly copied using an enzyme called RNA replicase. This enzyme then uses that RNA copy as a template to make hundreds of duplicates of the original RNA. A second group of RNA-containing viruses, called the retroviruses, uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA so that the virus\'s genetic information is contained in a molecule of DNA rather than RNA. The viral DNA can then be further replicated using the resources of the host cell.\n[edit]\n\nOutline\n\n   1. Attachment, sometimes called absorption: The virus attaches to receptors on the host cell wall.\n   2. Injection: The nucleic acid of the virus moves through the plasma membrane and into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The capsid of a phage, a bacterial virus, remains on the outside. In contrast, many viruses that infect animal cells enter the host cell intact.\n   3. Replication: The viral genome contains all the information necessary to produce new viruses. Once inside the host cell, the virus induces the host cell to synthesize the necessary components for its replication.\n   4. Assembly: The newly synthesized viral components are assembled into new viruses.\n   5. Release: Assembled viruses are released from the cell and can now infect other cells, and the process begins again.\n\nWhen the virus has taken over the cell, it immediately causes the host to begin manufacturing the proteins necessary for virus reproduction. Some viruses, like herpes, cause the host to produce three kinds of proteins: early proteins, enzymes used in nucleic acid replication; late proteins, proteins used to construct the virus coat; and lytic proteins, enzymes used to break open the cell for viral exit. The final viral product is assembled spontaneously, that is, the parts are made separately by the host and are joined together by chance. This self-assembly is often aided by molecular chaperones, or proteins made by the host that help the capsid parts come together.\n\nThe new viruses then leave the cell either by exocytosis or by lysis. Envelope-bound animal viruses cause the host\'s endoplasmic reticulum to make certain proteins, called glycoproteins, which then collect in clumps along the cell membrane. The virus is then discharged from the cell at these exit sites, referred to as exocytosis. On the other hand, bacteriophages must break open, or lyse, the cell to exit. To do this, the phages have a gene that codes for an enzyme called lysozyme. This enzyme breaks down the cell wall, causing the cell to swell and burst. The new viruses are released into the environment, killing the host cell in the process.\n',NULL),(25,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:1c047f0:1074865a9a8:-7fe8','2005-10-31 15:45:17',1,'Viruses: non-living or alive?\n',NULL),(26,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:1c047f0:1074865a9a8:-7fe7','2005-10-31 15:45:24',10513,'\nStudy and applications\n[edit]\n\nExploring basic cellular processes\n\nViruses are important to the study of molecular and cellular biology because they provide simple systems that can be used to manipulate and investigate the functions of cells. The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about many aspects of cell biology. For example, viruses have further simplified the study of genetics and have deepened our understanding of the basic mechanisms of molecular genetics (DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing), protein transport, and immunology.\n[edit]\n\nGenetic engineering\n\nGeneticists regularly use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying. Attempts to treat human diseases through the use of viruses as tools of genetic engineering is one goal of gene therapy. However, in a high profile gene-therapy clinical trial, deaths occurred by the viral vectors used to treat the patients. This has caused the general public to be very cautious with continual trials using the once heralded scientific technique.\n[edit]\n\nMaterials science and nanotechnology\n\nScientists at MIT have recently been able to use viruses to create metallic wires, and they have the potential to be used for binding to exotic materials, self-assembly, liquid crystals, solar cells, batteries, fuel cells, and many other interesting areas.\n\nThe essential idea is to use a virus with a known protein on its surface. The location of the code for this protein is in a known location in the DNA, and by randomizing that sequence it can create a phage library of millions of different viruses, each with a different protein expressed on its surface. By using natural selection, one can then find a particular strain of this virus which has a binding affinity for a given material.\n\nFor example, one can isolate a virus which has a high affinity for gold. Taking this virus and growing gold nanoparticles around it results in the gold nanoparticles being incorporated into the virus coat, resulting in a gold wire of precise length and shape with biological origins.\n\nCurrent thinking is that viruses will one day be created which can act as agents on behalf of bio-mechanical healing devices giving humans or other animals extended life.\n[edit]\n\nHuman viral diseases\n\nExamples of diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, which is caused by any one of a variety of related viruses; smallpox; AIDS, which is caused by HIV; and cold sores, which are caused by herpes simplex. Other connections are being studied such as the connection of HHV-6 in organic neurological diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Recently it has been shown that cervical cancer is caused at least partly by papillomavirus (which causes papillomas, or warts), representing the first significant evidence in humans for a link between cancer and an infective agent. There is current controversy over whether borna virus, previously thought of primarily as the causative agent of neurological disease in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illness in humans. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence.\n\nThe ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has led to concern that viruses will be weaponized for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of a virus in a laboratory. Much concern revolves around the smallpox virus, which has devastated numerous societies throughout history, and today is extinct in the wild. In fact, smallpox has been used in a crude form of biological warfare by British colonists against a tribe of Native Americans.\n\nThis episode of biological warfare was part of a larger phenomenon of Native American populations being devastated by contagious diseases, particularly smallpox, brought to the Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by smallpox after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but it may have been very large. The damage done by this disease may have significantly aided European attempts to displace or conquer the native population. Jared Diamond argued in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel that highly contagious diseases develop in agricultural societies and regularly aid those societies when they expand into the territories of non-agricultural peoples.\n\nOf all types of virus, the most deadly are known as filovirus. The Filovirus group consists of Marburg, first discovered in 1967 in Marburg Germany, and ebola. Filovirus are long, worm-like virus particles that, in large groups, resemble a plate of noodles. As of April 2005, the Marburg virus is attracting widespread press attention for an outbreak in Angola. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, the outbreak, which now appears to be coming under control, is the world\'s worst epidemic of any kind of hemorrhagic fever.\n[edit]\n\nLaboratory diagnosis of pathogenic viruses\n\nDetection and subsequent isolation of viruses from patients is a very specialised laboratory subject. Normally it requires the use of large facilities, expensive equipment, and highly trained specialists such as technicians, molecular biologists, and virologists. Often, this effort is undertaken by state and national governments and shared internationally through organizations like WHO.\n[edit]\n\nPrevention and treatment of viral diseases\n\nBecause they use the machinery their host cells produce, viruses are difficult to kill. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases, thus far, are vaccination to provide resistance to infection, and drugs that treat the symptoms of viral infections. Patients often ask for antibiotics, which are useless against viruses, and their misuse against viral infections is one of the causes of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. That said, sometimes, in life-threatening situations, the prudent course of action is to begin a course of antibiotic treatment while waiting for test results to determine whether the patient\'s symptoms are caused by a virus or a bacterial infection.\n[edit]\n\nEtymology\n\nAlthough the viruses were discovered by the Russian biologist Dmitry Ivanovsky in 1892, the name for them was coined later. The original word comes from the Latin virus referring to poison and other noxious things. Today it is used to describe the biological viruses discussed above and also as a metaphor for other parasitically-reproducing things, such as memes or computer viruses. The word virion or viron is used to refer to a single infective viral particle.\n\nThe English plural form of virus is viruses. No reputable dictionary gives any other form, including such \"reconstructed\" Latin plural forms as viri (which actually means men). (No plural form appears in any extant Latin manuscript). (See plural of virus). The word does not have a traditional Latin plural because its original sense, poison is a mass noun like the English word furniture.\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n    * Horizontal gene transfer\n    * List of viruses\n    * Microbiology\n    * Prion\n    * Viral plaque\n    * Viroids\n    * Virology\n    * Virus classification\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n    * Wikipedia:WikiProject Viruses\n    * WikiSpecies:Virus\n    * Wiktionary:en:virus\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n    * All the Virology on the WWW\n    * Radetsky, Peter (1994).

Viruses are neither unicellular nor multicellular organisms; they are somewhere between being living and non-living. Viruses have genes and show inheritance, but are reliant on host cells to produce new generations of viruses. Many viruses have similarities to complex molecules. Because viruses are dependent on host cells for their replication they are generally not classified as \"living\". Whether or not they are \"alive\", they are obligate parasites, and have no form which can reproduce independently of their host. Like most parasites, they have a specific host range, sometimes specific to one species (or even limited cell types of one species) and sometimes more general.\n\nViruses form when molecules are assembled from organic compounds providing complex, microscopic structures which have the potential for self-assembly, and thus they have great implications for the study of the origin of life. Some viruses form by self-assembly of protein and nucleic acid molecules. These macromolecules are assembled within host cells from smaller organic compounds. Virus self-assembly has implications for the study of the origin of life. Some viruses also incorporate lipids from the host cell membrane when their core protein-nucleic acid complex buds from the surface of a host cell.

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites; they can reproduce only by invading and controlling other cells as they lack the cellular machinery for self reproduction. The term virus usually refers to those particles which infect eukaryotes (multi-celled organisms and many single-celled organisms), whilst the term bacteriophage or phage is used to describe those infecting prokaryotes (bacteria and bacteria-like organisms). Typically these particles carry a small amount of nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA, but not both) surrounded by some form of protective coat consisting of proteins, lipids, glycoproteins or a combination. Importantly, viral genomes code not only for the proteins needed to package its genetic material, but for proteins needed by the virus during its life cycle (the term \"life cycle\" used loosely here as viruses are not, as was stated, alive).\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Origins\n    * 2 Size, structure, and anatomy\n    * 3 Replication\n          o 3.1 Outline\n    * 4 Non-living or alive?\n    * 5 Study and applications\n          o 5.1 Exploring basic cellular processes\n          o 5.2 Genetic engineering\n          o 5.3 Materials science and nanotechnology\n    * 6 Human viral diseases\n          o 6.1 Laboratory diagnosis of pathogenic viruses\n          o 6.2 Prevention and treatment of viral diseases\n    * 7 Etymology\n    * 8 See also\n          o 8.1 See also\n    * 9 References\n          o 9.1 Numbered references\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins\n\nThe origin of viruses is not entirely clear, but the currently favoured explanation is that they are derived from their host organisms, originating from transferrable elements like plasmids or transposons. It has also been suggested that they may represent extremely reduced microbes, which appeared separately in the primordial soup that gave rise to the first cells, or that the different sorts of viruses appeared through different mechanisms.\n\nOther infectious particles which are even simpler in structure than viruses include viroids, virusoids, and prions.\n[edit]\n\nSize, structure, and anatomy\n\nVirus particles comprise a nucleic acid genome that may be either DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded, and positive or negative sense. This is surrounded (encapsidated) by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The viral capsid may be either spherical or helical and is composed of proteins encoded by the viral genome. In helical viruses, the capsid protein (frequently called the nucleocapsid protein) binds directly to the viral genome. For example, in the case of the measles virus, one nucleocapsid protein binds every six bases of RNA to form a helix approximately 1.3 micrometers in length. This complex of protein and nucleic acid is called the nucleocapsid, and, in the case of the measles virus, is enclosed in a lipid \"envelope\" acquired from the host cell, in which virus-encoded glycoproteins are embedded. These are responsible for binding to and entering the host cell at the start of a new infection. Spherical virus capsids completely enclose the viral genome and do not generally bind as tightly to the nucleic acid as helical capsid proteins do. These structures can range in size from less than 20 nanometers up to 400 nanometers and are composed of viral proteins arranged with icosahedral symmetry. Icosahedral architecture is the same principle employed by R. Buckminster-Fuller in his geodesic dome, and it is the most efficient way of creating an enclosed robust structure from multiple copies of a single protein. The number of proteins required to form a spherical virus capsid is denoted by the \"T-number\" whereby 60t proteins are necessary. In the case of the hepatitis B virus, the T-number is 4, therefore 240 proteins assemble to form the capsid. As in the helical viruses, the spherical virus capsid may be enclosed in a lipid envelope, although frequently spherical viruses are not enveloped, and the capsid proteins themselves are directly involved in attachment and entry into the host cell. The complete virus particle is referred to as a virion. A virion is little more than a gene transporter, and components of the envelope and capsid provide the mechanism for injecting the viral genome into a host cell[1].\n[edit]\n\nReplication\n\nBecause viruses are acellular and do not have their own metabolism, they must utilize the machinery and metabolism of the host to reproduce. Before a virus has entered a host cell, it is called a virion â€” a package of viral genetic material. Virions can be passed from host to host either through direct contact or through a vector, or carrier. Inside the organism, the virus can enter a cell in various ways. Bacteriophagesâ€”bacterial virusesâ€”attach to the cell wall surface in specific places. Once attached, enzymes make a small hole in the cell wall, and the virus injects its DNA into the cell. Other viruses (such as HIV) enter the host via endocytosis, the process whereby cells take in material from the external environment. After entering the cell, the virus\'s genetic material begins the destructive process of causing the cell to produce new viruses.\n\nThere are three different ways genetic information contained in a viral genome can be reproduced. The form of genetic material contained in the viral capsid, the protein coat that surrounds the nucleic acid, determines the exact replication process.\n\nSome viruses have DNA, which once inside the host cell is replicated by the host along with its own DNA.\n\nThere are two different replication processes for viruses containing RNA. In the first process, the viral RNA is directly copied using an enzyme called RNA replicase. This enzyme then uses that RNA copy as a template to make hundreds of duplicates of the original RNA. A second group of RNA-containing viruses, called the retroviruses, uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA so that the virus\'s genetic information is contained in a molecule of DNA rather than RNA. The viral DNA can then be further replicated using the resources of the host cell.\n[edit]\n\nOutline\n\n   1. Attachment, sometimes called absorption: The virus attaches to receptors on the host cell wall.\n   2. Injection: The nucleic acid of the virus moves through the plasma membrane and into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The capsid of a phage, a bacterial virus, remains on the outside. In contrast, many viruses that infect animal cells enter the host cell intact.\n   3. Replication: The viral genome contains all the information necessary to produce new viruses. Once inside the host cell, the virus induces the host cell to synthesize the necessary components for its replication.\n   4. Assembly: The newly synthesized viral components are assembled into new viruses.\n   5. Release: Assembled viruses are released from the cell and can now infect other cells, and the process begins again.\n\nWhen the virus has taken over the cell, it immediately causes the host to begin manufacturing the proteins necessary for virus reproduction. Some viruses, like herpes, cause the host to produce three kinds of proteins: early proteins, enzymes used in nucleic acid replication; late proteins, proteins used to construct the virus coat; and lytic proteins, enzymes used to break open the cell for viral exit. The final viral product is assembled spontaneously, that is, the parts are made separately by the host and are joined together by chance. This self-assembly is often aided by molecular chaperones, or proteins made by the host that help the capsid parts come together.\n\nThe new viruses then leave the cell either by exocytosis or by lysis. Envelope-bound animal viruses cause the host\'s endoplasmic reticulum to make certain proteins, called glycoproteins, which then collect in clumps along the cell membrane. The virus is then discharged from the cell at these exit sites, referred to as exocytosis. On the other hand, bacteriophages must break open, or lyse, the cell to exit. To do this, the phages have a gene that codes for an enzyme called lysozyme. This enzyme breaks down the cell wall, causing the cell to swell and burst. The new viruses are released into the environment, killing the host cell in the process.\n\nA virus may makes use of existing host enzymes and other molecules of a host cell to create more virus particles (virions), although some viruses encode their own replication machinery and are not reliant on host enzymes for replication. Viruses are neither unicellular nor multicellular organisms; they are somewhere between being living and non-living. Viruses have genes and show inheritance, but are reliant on host cells to produce new generations of viruses. Many viruses have similarities to complex molecules. Because viruses are dependent on host cells for their replication they are generally not classified as \"living\". Whether or not they are \"alive\", they are obligate parasites, and have no form which can reproduce independently of their host. Like most parasites, they have a specific host range, sometimes specific to one species (or even limited cell types of one species) and sometimes more general.\n\nViruses form when molecules are assembled from organic compounds providing complex, microscopic structures which have the potential for self-assembly, and thus they have great implications for the study of the origin of life. Some viruses form by self-assembly of protein and nucleic acid molecules. These macromolecules are assembled within host cells from smaller organic compounds. Virus self-assembly has implications for the study of the origin of life. Some viruses also incorporate lipids from the host cell membrane when their core protein-nucleic acid complex buds from the surface of a host cell.  Concerning whether viruses are alive or not, if the requirement for autonomous self-reproduction is abandoned, it can be argued strongly that viruses are indeed alive. Some small viruses are more efficient than most cellular life forms as their ratio of functions to working parts is so high. If viruses are alive then the prospect of creating artificial life is enhanced or at least the standards required to call something artificially alive are reduced.\n\nStudy and applications\n[edit]\n\nExploring basic cellular processes\n\nViruses are important to the study of molecular and cellular biology because they provide simple systems that can be used to manipulate and investigate the functions of cells. The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about many aspects of cell biology. For example, viruses have further simplified the study of genetics and have deepened our understanding of the basic mechanisms of molecular genetics (DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing), protein transport, and immunology.\n[edit]\n\nGenetic engineering\n\nGeneticists regularly use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying. Attempts to treat human diseases through the use of viruses as tools of genetic engineering is one goal of gene therapy. However, in a high profile gene-therapy clinical trial, deaths occurred by the viral vectors used to treat the patients. This has caused the general public to be very cautious with continual trials using the once heralded scientific technique.\n[edit]\n\nMaterials science and nanotechnology\n\nScientists at MIT have recently been able to use viruses to create metallic wires, and they have the potential to be used for binding to exotic materials, self-assembly, liquid crystals, solar cells, batteries, fuel cells, and many other interesting areas.\n\nThe essential idea is to use a virus with a known protein on its surface. The location of the code for this protein is in a known location in the DNA, and by randomizing that sequence it can create a phage library of millions of different viruses, each with a different protein expressed on its surface. By using natural selection, one can then find a particular strain of this virus which has a binding affinity for a given material.\n\nFor example, one can isolate a virus which has a high affinity for gold. Taking this virus and growing gold nanoparticles around it results in the gold nanoparticles being incorporated into the virus coat, resulting in a gold wire of precise length and shape with biological origins.\n\nCurrent thinking is that viruses will one day be created which can act as agents on behalf of bio-mechanical healing devices giving humans or other animals extended life.\n[edit]\n\nHuman viral diseases\n\nExamples of diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, which is caused by any one of a variety of related viruses; smallpox; AIDS, which is caused by HIV; and cold sores, which are caused by herpes simplex. Other connections are being studied such as the connection of HHV-6 in organic neurological diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Recently it has been shown that cervical cancer is caused at least partly by papillomavirus (which causes papillomas, or warts), representing the first significant evidence in humans for a link between cancer and an infective agent. There is current controversy over whether borna virus, previously thought of primarily as the causative agent of neurological disease in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illness in humans. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence.\n\nThe ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has led to concern that viruses will be weaponized for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of a virus in a laboratory. Much concern revolves around the smallpox virus, which has devastated numerous societies throughout history, and today is extinct in the wild. In fact, smallpox has been used in a crude form of biological warfare by British colonists against a tribe of Native Americans.\n\nThis episode of biological warfare was part of a larger phenomenon of Native American populations being devastated by contagious diseases, particularly smallpox, brought to the Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by smallpox after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but it may have been very large. The damage done by this disease may have significantly aided European attempts to displace or conquer the native population. Jared Diamond argued in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel that highly contagious diseases develop in agricultural societies and regularly aid those societies when they expand into the territories of non-agricultural peoples.\n\nOf all types of virus, the most deadly are known as filovirus. The Filovirus group consists of Marburg, first discovered in 1967 in Marburg Germany, and ebola. Filovirus are long, worm-like virus particles that, in large groups, resemble a plate of noodles. As of April 2005, the Marburg virus is attracting widespread press attention for an outbreak in Angola. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, the outbreak, which now appears to be coming under control, is the world\'s worst epidemic of any kind of hemorrhagic fever.\n[edit]\n\nLaboratory diagnosis of pathogenic viruses\n\nDetection and subsequent isolation of viruses from patients is a very specialised laboratory subject. Normally it requires the use of large facilities, expensive equipment, and highly trained specialists such as technicians, molecular biologists, and virologists. Often, this effort is undertaken by state and national governments and shared internationally through organizations like WHO.\n[edit]\n\nPrevention and treatment of viral diseases\n\nBecause they use the machinery their host cells produce, viruses are difficult to kill. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases, thus far, are vaccination to provide resistance to infection, and drugs that treat the symptoms of viral infections. Patients often ask for antibiotics, which are useless against viruses, and their misuse against viral infections is one of the causes of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. That said, sometimes, in life-threatening situations, the prudent course of action is to begin a course of antibiotic treatment while waiting for test results to determine whether the patient\'s symptoms are caused by a virus or a bacterial infection.\n[edit]\n\nEtymology\n\nAlthough the viruses were discovered by the Russian biologist Dmitry Ivanovsky in 1892, the name for them was coined later. The original word comes from the Latin virus referring to poison and other noxious things. Today it is used to describe the biological viruses discussed above and also as a metaphor for other parasitically-reproducing things, such as memes or computer viruses. The word virion or viron is used to refer to a single infective viral particle.\n\nThe English plural form of virus is viruses. No reputable dictionary gives any other form, including such \"reconstructed\" Latin plural forms as viri (which actually means men). (No plural form appears in any extant Latin manuscript). (See plural of virus). The word does not have a traditional Latin plural because its original sense, poison is a mass noun like the English word furniture.\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n    * Horizontal gene transfer\n    * List of viruses\n    * Microbiology\n    * Prion\n    * Viral plaque\n    * Viroids\n    * Virology\n    * Virus classification\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n    * Wikipedia:WikiProject Viruses\n    * WikiSpecies:Virus\n    * Wiktionary:en:virus\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n    * All the Virology on the WWW\n    * Radetsky, Peter (1994).

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites; they can reproduce only by invading and controlling other cells as they lack the cellular machinery for self reproduction. The term virus usually refers to those particles which infect eukaryotes (multi-celled organisms and many single-celled organisms), whilst the term bacteriophage or phage is used to describe those infecting prokaryotes (bacteria and bacteria-like organisms). Typically these particles carry a small amount of nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA, but not both) surrounded by some form of protective coat consisting of proteins, lipids, glycoproteins or a combination. Importantly, viral genomes code not only for the proteins needed to package its genetic material, but for proteins needed by the virus during its life cycle (the term \"life cycle\" used loosely here as viruses are not, as was stated, alive).\n\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Origins\n    * 2 Size, structure, and anatomy\n    * 3 Replication\n          o 3.1 Outline\n    * 4 Non-living or alive?\n    * 5 Study and applications\n          o 5.1 Exploring basic cellular processes\n          o 5.2 Genetic engineering\n          o 5.3 Materials science and nanotechnology\n    * 6 Human viral diseases\n          o 6.1 Laboratory diagnosis of pathogenic viruses\n          o 6.2 Prevention and treatment of viral diseases\n    * 7 Etymology\n    * 8 See also\n          o 8.1 See also\n    * 9 References\n          o 9.1 Numbered references\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins\n\nThe origin of viruses is not entirely clear, but the currently favoured explanation is that they are derived from their host organisms, originating from transferrable elements like plasmids or transposons. It has also been suggested that they may represent extremely reduced microbes, which appeared separately in the primordial soup that gave rise to the first cells, or that the different sorts of viruses appeared through different mechanisms.\n\nOther infectious particles which are even simpler in structure than viruses include viroids, virusoids, and prions.\n[edit]\n\nSize, structure, and anatomy\n\nVirus particles comprise a nucleic acid genome that may be either DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded, and positive or negative sense. This is surrounded (encapsidated) by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The viral capsid may be either spherical or helical and is composed of proteins encoded by the viral genome. In helical viruses, the capsid protein (frequently called the nucleocapsid protein) binds directly to the viral genome. For example, in the case of the measles virus, one nucleocapsid protein binds every six bases of RNA to form a helix approximately 1.3 micrometers in length. This complex of protein and nucleic acid is called the nucleocapsid, and, in the case of the measles virus, is enclosed in a lipid \"envelope\" acquired from the host cell, in which virus-encoded glycoproteins are embedded. These are responsible for binding to and entering the host cell at the start of a new infection. Spherical virus capsids completely enclose the viral genome and do not generally bind as tightly to the nucleic acid as helical capsid proteins do. These structures can range in size from less than 20 nanometers up to 400 nanometers and are composed of viral proteins arranged with icosahedral symmetry. Icosahedral architecture is the same principle employed by R. Buckminster-Fuller in his geodesic dome, and it is the most efficient way of creating an enclosed robust structure from multiple copies of a single protein. The number of proteins required to form a spherical virus capsid is denoted by the \"T-number\" whereby 60t proteins are necessary. In the case of the hepatitis B virus, the T-number is 4, therefore 240 proteins assemble to form the capsid. As in the helical viruses, the spherical virus capsid may be enclosed in a lipid envelope, although frequently spherical viruses are not enveloped, and the capsid proteins themselves are directly involved in attachment and entry into the host cell. The complete virus particle is referred to as a virion. A virion is little more than a gene transporter, and components of the envelope and capsid provide the mechanism for injecting the viral genome into a host cell[1].\n[edit]\n\nReplication\n\nBecause viruses are acellular and do not have their own metabolism, they must utilize the machinery and metabolism of the host to reproduce. Before a virus has entered a host cell, it is called a virion â€” a package of viral genetic material. Virions can be passed from host to host either through direct contact or through a vector, or carrier. Inside the organism, the virus can enter a cell in various ways. Bacteriophagesâ€”bacterial virusesâ€”attach to the cell wall surface in specific places. Once attached, enzymes make a small hole in the cell wall, and the virus injects its DNA into the cell. Other viruses (such as HIV) enter the host via endocytosis, the process whereby cells take in material from the external environment. After entering the cell, the virus\'s genetic material begins the destructive process of causing the cell to produce new viruses.\n\nThere are three different ways genetic information contained in a viral genome can be reproduced. The form of genetic material contained in the viral capsid, the protein coat that surrounds the nucleic acid, determines the exact replication process.\n\nSome viruses have DNA, which once inside the host cell is replicated by the host along with its own DNA.\n\nThere are two different replication processes for viruses containing RNA. In the first process, the viral RNA is directly copied using an enzyme called RNA replicase. This enzyme then uses that RNA copy as a template to make hundreds of duplicates of the original RNA. A second group of RNA-containing viruses, called the retroviruses, uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA so that the virus\'s genetic information is contained in a molecule of DNA rather than RNA. The viral DNA can then be further replicated using the resources of the host cell.\n[edit]\n\nOutline\n\n   1. Attachment, sometimes called absorption: The virus attaches to receptors on the host cell wall.\n   2. Injection: The nucleic acid of the virus moves through the plasma membrane and into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The capsid of a phage, a bacterial virus, remains on the outside. In contrast, many viruses that infect animal cells enter the host cell intact.\n   3. Replication: The viral genome contains all the information necessary to produce new viruses. Once inside the host cell, the virus induces the host cell to synthesize the necessary components for its replication.\n   4. Assembly: The newly synthesized viral components are assembled into new viruses.\n   5. Release: Assembled viruses are released from the cell and can now infect other cells, and the process begins again.\n\nWhen the virus has taken over the cell, it immediately causes the host to begin manufacturing the proteins necessary for virus reproduction. Some viruses, like herpes, cause the host to produce three kinds of proteins: early proteins, enzymes used in nucleic acid replication; late proteins, proteins used to construct the virus coat; and lytic proteins, enzymes used to break open the cell for viral exit. The final viral product is assembled spontaneously, that is, the parts are made separately by the host and are joined together by chance. This self-assembly is often aided by molecular chaperones, or proteins made by the host that help the capsid parts come together.\n\nThe new viruses then leave the cell either by exocytosis or by lysis. Envelope-bound animal viruses cause the host\'s endoplasmic reticulum to make certain proteins, called glycoproteins, which then collect in clumps along the cell membrane. The virus is then discharged from the cell at these exit sites, referred to as exocytosis. On the other hand, bacteriophages must break open, or lyse, the cell to exit. To do this, the phages have a gene that codes for an enzyme called lysozyme. This enzyme breaks down the cell wall, causing the cell to swell and burst. The new viruses are released into the environment, killing the host cell in the process.\n\nA virus may makes use of existing host enzymes and other molecules of a host cell to create more virus particles (virions), although some viruses encode their own replication machinery and are not reliant on host enzymes for replication. Viruses are neither unicellular nor multicellular organisms; they are somewhere between being living and non-living. Viruses have genes and show inheritance, but are reliant on host cells to produce new generations of viruses. Many viruses have similarities to complex molecules. Because viruses are dependent on host cells for their replication they are generally not classified as \"living\". Whether or not they are \"alive\", they are obligate parasites, and have no form which can reproduce independently of their host. Like most parasites, they have a specific host range, sometimes specific to one species (or even limited cell types of one species) and sometimes more general.\n\nViruses form when molecules are assembled from organic compounds providing complex, microscopic structures which have the potential for self-assembly, and thus they have great implications for the study of the origin of life. Some viruses form by self-assembly of protein and nucleic acid molecules. These macromolecules are assembled within host cells from smaller organic compounds. Virus self-assembly has implications for the study of the origin of life. Some viruses also incorporate lipids from the host cell membrane when their core protein-nucleic acid complex buds from the surface of a host cell.  Concerning whether viruses are alive or not, if the requirement for autonomous self-reproduction is abandoned, it can be argued strongly that viruses are indeed alive. Some small viruses are more efficient than most cellular life forms as their ratio of functions to working parts is so high. If viruses are alive then the prospect of creating artificial life is enhanced or at least the standards required to call something artificially alive are reduced.\n\nStudy and applications\n[edit]\n\nExploring basic cellular processes\n\nViruses are important to the study of molecular and cellular biology because they provide simple systems that can be used to manipulate and investigate the functions of cells. The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about many aspects of cell biology. For example, viruses have further simplified the study of genetics and have deepened our understanding of the basic mechanisms of molecular genetics (DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing), protein transport, and immunology.\n[edit]\n\nGenetic engineering\n\nGeneticists regularly use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying. Attempts to treat human diseases through the use of viruses as tools of genetic engineering is one goal of gene therapy. However, in a high profile gene-therapy clinical trial, deaths occurred by the viral vectors used to treat the patients. This has caused the general public to be very cautious with continual trials using the once heralded scientific technique.\n[edit]\n\nMaterials science and nanotechnology\n\nScientists at MIT have recently been able to use viruses to create metallic wires, and they have the potential to be used for binding to exotic materials, self-assembly, liquid crystals, solar cells, batteries, fuel cells, and many other interesting areas.\n\nThe essential idea is to use a virus with a known protein on its surface. The location of the code for this protein is in a known location in the DNA, and by randomizing that sequence it can create a phage library of millions of different viruses, each with a different protein expressed on its surface. By using natural selection, one can then find a particular strain of this virus which has a binding affinity for a given material.\n\nFor example, one can isolate a virus which has a high affinity for gold. Taking this virus and growing gold nanoparticles around it results in the gold nanoparticles being incorporated into the virus coat, resulting in a gold wire of precise length and shape with biological origins.\n\nCurrent thinking is that viruses will one day be created which can act as agents on behalf of bio-mechanical healing devices giving humans or other animals extended life.\n[edit]\n\nHuman viral diseases\n\nExamples of diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, which is caused by any one of a variety of related viruses; smallpox; AIDS, which is caused by HIV; and cold sores, which are caused by herpes simplex. Other connections are being studied such as the connection of HHV-6 in organic neurological diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Recently it has been shown that cervical cancer is caused at least partly by papillomavirus (which causes papillomas, or warts), representing the first significant evidence in humans for a link between cancer and an infective agent. There is current controversy over whether borna virus, previously thought of primarily as the causative agent of neurological disease in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illness in humans. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence.\n\nThe ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has led to concern that viruses will be weaponized for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of a virus in a laboratory. Much concern revolves around the smallpox virus, which has devastated numerous societies throughout history, and today is extinct in the wild. In fact, smallpox has been used in a crude form of biological warfare by British colonists against a tribe of Native Americans.\n\nThis episode of biological warfare was part of a larger phenomenon of Native American populations being devastated by contagious diseases, particularly smallpox, brought to the Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by smallpox after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but it may have been very large. The damage done by this disease may have significantly aided European attempts to displace or conquer the native population. Jared Diamond argued in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel that highly contagious diseases develop in agricultural societies and regularly aid those societies when they expand into the territories of non-agricultural peoples.\n\nOf all types of virus, the most deadly are known as filovirus. The Filovirus group consists of Marburg, first discovered in 1967 in Marburg Germany, and ebola. Filovirus are long, worm-like virus particles that, in large groups, resemble a plate of noodles. As of April 2005, the Marburg virus is attracting widespread press attention for an outbreak in Angola. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, the outbreak, which now appears to be coming under control, is the world\'s worst epidemic of any kind of hemorrhagic fever.\n[edit]\n\nLaboratory diagnosis of pathogenic viruses\n\nDetection and subsequent isolation of viruses from patients is a very specialised laboratory subject. Normally it requires the use of large facilities, expensive equipment, and highly trained specialists such as technicians, molecular biologists, and virologists. Often, this effort is undertaken by state and national governments and shared internationally through organizations like WHO.\n[edit]\n\nPrevention and treatment of viral diseases\n\nBecause they use the machinery their host cells produce, viruses are difficult to kill. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases, thus far, are vaccination to provide resistance to infection, and drugs that treat the symptoms of viral infections. Patients often ask for antibiotics, which are useless against viruses, and their misuse against viral infections is one of the causes of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. That said, sometimes, in life-threatening situations, the prudent course of action is to begin a course of antibiotic treatment while waiting for test results to determine whether the patient\'s symptoms are caused by a virus or a bacterial infection.\n[edit]\n\nEtymology\n\nAlthough the viruses were discovered by the Russian biologist Dmitry Ivanovsky in 1892, the name for them was coined later. The original word comes from the Latin virus referring to poison and other noxious things. Today it is used to describe the biological viruses discussed above and also as a metaphor for other parasitically-reproducing things, such as memes or computer viruses. The word virion or viron is used to refer to a single infective viral particle.\n\nThe English plural form of virus is viruses. No reputable dictionary gives any other form, including such \"reconstructed\" Latin plural forms as viri (which actually means men). (No plural form appears in any extant Latin manuscript). (See plural of virus). The word does not have a traditional Latin plural because its original sense, poison is a mass noun like the English word furniture.\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n    * Horizontal gene transfer\n    * List of viruses\n    * Microbiology\n    * Prion\n    * Viral plaque\n    * Viroids\n    * Virology\n    * Virus classification\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n    * Wikipedia:WikiProject Viruses\n    * WikiSpecies:Virus\n    * Wiktionary:en:virus\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n    * All the Virology on the WWW\n    * Radetsky, Peter (1994).

Viruses are neither unicellular nor multicellular organisms; they are somewhere between being living and non-living. Viruses have genes and show inheritance, but are reliant on host cells to produce new generations of viruses. Many viruses have similarities to complex molecules. Because viruses are dependent on host cells for their replication they are generally not classified as \"living\". Whether or not they are \"alive\", they are obligate parasites, and have no form which can reproduce independently of their host. Like most parasites, they have a specific host range, sometimes specific to one species (or even limited cell types of one species) and sometimes more general.\n\nViruses form when molecules are assembled from organic compounds providing complex, microscopic structures which have the potential for self-assembly, and thus they have great implications for the study of the origin of life. Some viruses form by self-assembly of protein and nucleic acid molecules. These macromolecules are assembled within host cells from smaller organic compounds. Virus self-assembly has implications for the study of the origin of life. Some viruses also incorporate lipids from the host cell membrane when their core protein-nucleic acid complex buds from the surface of a host cell.  Concerning whether viruses are alive or not, if the requirement for autonomous self-reproduction is abandoned, it can be argued strongly that viruses are indeed alive. Some small viruses are more efficient than most cellular life forms as their ratio of functions to working parts is so high. If vViruses are alive, so  then the prospect of creating artificial life ihas been enhanced or at least the standards required to call something artificially alive have beenare reduced.\n',NULL),(99,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:91cf0b:107489fdf52:-7fd6','2005-10-31 16:41:01',30,'Viruses: non-living or alive?',NULL),(100,1,'11d1def534ea1be0:91cf0b:107489fdf52:-7fd5','2005-10-31 16:41:03',1,'[[Deleted for NPOV status]]\n\n',NULL),(101,2,'11d1def534ea1be0:91cf0b:107489fdf52:-7fb8','2005-10-31 16:41:31',112,'[[TODO: Determine when this version of this section is from]]\n\n',NULL),(102,3,'11d1def534ea1be0:91cf0b:107489fdf52:-7fb6','2005-10-31 16:42:03',112,'[[TODO: Determine when this version of this section is from]]',NULL),(530,2,'c446fdcae989f991:e7908ae:10af0e463d1:-8000','2006-05-01 13:00:00',348,'Viruses',NULL),(105,4,'bd7a29f3edfad5ae:-25240d7f:107544f8314:-8000','2005-11-02 23:03:34',0,'Greendale Website',NULL),(107,4,'bd7a29f3edfad5ae:2025a0e6:107617f4a17:-8000','2005-11-05 12:35:36',0,'\"falling from above\" web lyrics',NULL),(108,2,'bd7a29f3edfad5ae:605b3a6b:1076192dc2f:-8000','2005-11-05 12:56:59',12,' Web',NULL),(109,1,'ca33afa83c0cdd3b:937cea:10771687119:-7ffa','2005-11-08 14:44:45',169,' this is not my case!',NULL),(110,1,'ca33afa83c0cdd3b:3d0d64:107d7e5ae17:-8000','2005-11-28 12:22:25',261,'  That Hermione Granger was able to use the Time-Turner--I shall also!',NULL),(111,3,'ca33afa83c0cdd3b:3d0d64:107d7e5ae17:-7f86','2005-11-28 12:23:31',263,'That Hermione Granger was able to use the Time-Turner--I shall also!\"',NULL),(112,1,'3fe29258d1efb468:e7bb91:107da129647:-7ffc','2005-11-28 22:31:22',2215,'But Little did he know, even in the darkest of his shadows he was being followed by Jack, one of Harry Potter\'s inner circle \"Friends\"; more like dispatches, making sure of Severus\'s whereabouts.

However swiftly the Cayenne Tern, the smaller Gulls or the Jager move on wing, it seems a matter of mere sport to it to overtake any of them. The Goshawk, the Peregrine, and the Gyr Falcon, which I conceive to be the swiftest of our Hawks, are obliged to pursue their victim, should it be a Green-winged Teal or Passenger Pigeon, at times for half a mile, at the highest pitch of their speed, before they can secure them. The bird of which I speak comes from on high with the velocity of a meteor, and on nearing the object of its pursuit, which its keen eye has spied while fishing at a distance, darts on either side to cut off all retreat, and with open bill forces it to drop or disgorge the fish which it has just caught. See him now! Yonder, over the waves leaps the brilliant dolphin, as he pursues the flying-fishes, which he expects to seize the moment they drop into the water. The Frigate-bird, who has marked them, closes his wings, dives toward them, and now ascending, holds one of the tiny things across his bill. Already fifty yards above the sea, he spies a porpoise in full chase, launches towards the spot, and in passing seizes the mullet that had escaped from its dreaded foe; but now, having obtained a fish too large for his gullet, he rises, munching it all the while, as if bound for the skies. Three or four of his own tribe have watched him and observed his success. They shoot towards him on broadly extended pinions, rise in wide circles, smoothly, yet as swiftly as himself. They are now all at the same height, and each as it overtakes him, lashes him with its wings, and tugs at his prey. See! one has fairly robbed him, but before he can secure the contested fish it drops. One of the other birds has caught it, but he is pursued by all. From bill to bill, and through the air, rapidly falls the fish, until it drops quite dead on the waters, and sinks into the deep. Whatever disappointment the hungry birds feel, they seem to deserve it all.\n\nWhen the morning light gladdens the face of nature, and while the warblers are yet waiting, in silence the first rays of the sun, whose appearance they will hail with songs of joy, the Frigate-bird, on extended pinions, sails from his roosting place. Slowly and gently, with retracted neck he glides, as if desirous of quietly trying the renovated strength of his wings. Toward the vast deep he moves, rising apace, and before any other bird views the bright orb emerging from the waters. Pure is the azure of the heavens, and rich the deep green of the smooth sea below; there is every prospect of the finest weather; and now the glad bird shakes his pinions; and far up into the air, far beyond the reach of man\'s unaided eye, he soars in his quiet but rapid flight. There he floats in the pure air, but thither can fancy alone follow him. Would that I could accompany him! But now I see him again, with half-closed wings, gently falling towards the sea. He pauses awhile, and again dives through the air. Thrice, four times, has he gradually approached the surface of the ocean; now he shakes his pinions as violently as the swordsman whirls his claymore; all is right; and he sweeps away, shooting to this side and that, in search of prey.\n\nThese birds see well at night, although they never go to sea excepting by day. At various times I have accidentally sailed by mangrove keys on which hundreds were roosted, and apparently sound asleep, when, on my firing a gun for the purpose of starting whatever birds might be there, they would all take to wing and sail as beautifully as during day, returning to the trees as the boats proceeded. They are by no means shy; indeed they seem unaware of danger from a gun, and rarely all go off when a party is shooting at them, until a considerable number has been obtained. The only difficulty I experienced in procuring them was on account of the height to which they so soon rose on leaving the trees; but we had excellent guns, and our worthy pilot\'s \"Long Tom\" distinguished itself above the rest. At one place, where we found many hundreds of them, they sailed for nearly half an hour over our heads, and about thirty were shot, some of them at a remarkable height, when we could hear the shot strike them, and when, as they fell to the water, the sound of their great wings whirling through the air resembled that produced by a sail flapping during a calm. When shot at and touched ever so slightly, they disgorge their food in the manner of Vultures, Gulls and some Terns; and if they have fallen and are approached, they continue to vomit the contents of their stomach, which at times are extremely putrid and nauseous. When seized, they evince little disposition to defend themselves, although ever so slightly wounded, but struggle and beat themselves until killed. Should you, however, place your fingers within their open bill, you might not withdraw them scatheless.',NULL),(452,2,'2d9067a76949ffba:bcecc7:1081a597865:-7fd1','2005-12-11 11:03:41',1,'KunguruKorppi\n\nKerran, kun ma raukeasti tutkin keskiyÃ¶hÃ¶n asti\nkirjaa, jossa polvet menneet seuloo salatietojaan,\nkuului koputusta jostain -- havahtuin ja pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤ nostain\nmietin, liekÃ¶ kammioistain Ã¤Ã¤ni moinen tullutkaan.\nUlkona kai seisoo joku oveani kolkuttain,\nmyÃ¶hÃ¤ vieras on se vain.\n\nUnhottaa en voi ma tuota -- lieden kylmenevÃ¤n luota\njoka hiille sammuessaan varjonsa loi lattiaan.\nVarroin pÃ¤ivÃ¤n pilkahdusta -- kirjoista hain lohdutusta --,\nmutta kauas murhe musta mieleni vei harhaamaan.\nAh, Lenore, suloimmyt mailla enkelten nyt on;\ntÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ tyhjyys pohjaton.\n\nKahistessa uutimien -- talven viiman tuutimien --\njouduin valtaan hurjan kammon, kuin en ennen milloinkaan.\nVihdoin sentÃ¤Ã¤n pois sen hÃ¤Ã¤sin -- tunteitteni herraks pÃ¤Ã¤sin,\nkun ma kauan hoin ja sÃ¤Ã¤sin: kohta siitÃ¤ selvÃ¤n saan --\nulkona kai seisoo joku oveani kolkuttain,\nmyÃ¶hÃ¤ vieras on se vain.\n\nKirvoituksen hetki lÃ¶i nyt -- enempÃ¤Ã¤ en epÃ¤rÃ¶inyt --:\n\"Anteeks suokaa\", lausuin, \"mutta vasta juuri havahduin.\nOtin pienen torkahduksen -- totta kyllÃ¤ takaa uksen\nheikon kuulin koputuksen, vaan sen miltei harhaks luin.\"\nOven vinhaan auki tyÃ¶nsin -- edessÃ¤ni sÃ¤psÃ¤htÃ¤in\npelkÃ¤n pimeyden nÃ¤in.\n\nPitkÃ¤Ã¤n siihen tuijottelin -- uudet tuskan vaiheet elin,\nmukaansa kun taas mun tempas pyÃ¶rteet unten hurjimpain.\nMutta mykkÃ¤nÃ¤ kuin mana tyhjyys muuttumattomana\npysyi, kunnes yksi sana ilmoille nous korahtain --\nkunnes alta ahdistuksen Ã¤Ã¤nnetyksi sain \'Lenore\'.\nKaiku vastas vain \'Lenore\'.\n\nViimein oven lukkoon kÃ¤Ã¤nsin, mielin raskain tieni kÃ¤Ã¤nsin\ntakaisin -- ja koputusta kuulin hiukan kovempaa.\nTÃ¤llÃ¤ kertaa ikkunalta lie se tullut -- mutta malta,\navata tuo mull\' on valta, salat kaikki paljastaa.\nHetkeks tyynny, sydÃ¤meni, koputuksen uuden kai\ntuuli yksin aikaan sai.\n\nLuukku aueta kun ehti, sisÃ¤Ã¤n tulla hyppelehti\nkorppi, joka mukanansa muinaisuuden tunnun toi.\nLuokseni sen mistÃ¤ sainkaan, tÃ¤ssÃ¤ kursailtu ei lainkaan --\nryhti herrain suurimpainkaan ylvÃ¤Ã¤mpi ei olla voi.\nPÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤n marmorisen Pallaan patsaan pyrÃ¤hti se istumaan,\nkuin ei muuta aikoiskaan.\n\nIlme tuima linnun vakaan lauhtunut ei hituistakaan,\nkun se kesken murheenikin hymyn loihti huulillein,\n\"TÃ¶yhtÃ¶ vaikk\' on viety sulta, et sa nÃ¤ytÃ¤ nolatulta --\nvielÃ¤ silmÃ¤s iskee tulta --, nimes lausu yksin tein.\nNimes lausu, jolla sua ikiyÃ¶ssÃ¤ mainitaan.\"\nKorppi huus: \"Ei milloinkaan.\"\n\nNoin kun vastas korppi musta, syvÃ¤Ã¤ tunsin kummastusta,\njoskaan en sen vastaukseen mieltÃ¤ saanut mahtumaan;\nsillÃ¤ ei kai tosissansa kukaan vÃ¤itÃ¤ muistavansa,\nettÃ¤ hÃ¤llÃ¤ vieraanansa keskiyÃ¶llÃ¤ huoneessaan\nkoskaan oisi ollut korppi -- keskiyÃ¶llÃ¤ vieraanaan --\nnimeltÃ¤ \'ei milloinkaan\'.\n\nHiljaisuutta kauan kesti -- istuimellaan ylhÃ¤isesti\nkorppi vuotti, kunnes pÃ¤Ã¤dyin puoliÃ¤Ã¤neen huokaamaan:\n\"Suotta multa aikees salaat -- kohta lÃ¤hteÃ¤ sa halaat,\naamun tullen jÃ¤lleen palaat ikiyÃ¶hÃ¶n ankeaan.\nNiinhÃ¤n muutkin ystÃ¤vÃ¤si hÃ¤ipyneet on aikoinaan.\"\nKorppi huus: \"Ei milloinkaan.\"\n\nIhme vÃ¤istyi ihmeen tieltÃ¤ -- nyt se puhui jÃ¤rjen kieltÃ¤,\nmutta ehkÃ¤pÃ¤ ei muuta sanoa se tainnutkaan.\nEhkÃ¤ joltain laulajalta, kohtalonsa murjomalta,\njoka onnen kukkulalta suistui kuiluun alimpaan,\nkorppi kolkon kertosÃ¤keen selvÃ¤Ã¤n oppi lausumaan:\n-- milloinkaan -- ei milloinkaan.\n\nElkeet oudot korpin tiukan taas mua hymyilytti hiukan --\nnojatuolin esiin tyÃ¶nsin, vaivuin silkkiin pehmeÃ¤Ã¤n.\nSiinÃ¤ mietin, siinÃ¤ pohdin -- tapaukset tarkoin johdin\ntoisistansa kaikin kohdin pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤kseni tietÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n,\nmihin korppi kylmÃ¤, kuiva, karsas pyrki vaakkuissaan\nyhÃ¤ vain \'ei milloinkaan\'.\n\nLamppu valoansa syyti -- sanat huulilleni hyyti\nkorpin katse sisimpÃ¤Ã¤ni kipeÃ¤sti tunkeissaan.\nVaan tuo katkerin ja ainoin valtaansa mun jÃ¤lleen sai noin,\nkun ma raskaan pÃ¤Ã¤ni painoin pielukseni purppuraan:\nsiihen, ah, ei hÃ¤nen pÃ¤Ã¤nsÃ¤ lampunvaloon nuokkumaan\nvaivu enÃ¤Ã¤ milloinkaan.\n\nSitten luulin tuntevani tuoksun vienon huoneessani,\nniin kuin enkelit ois kÃ¤yneet suitsutusta polttamaan.\n\"Vihdoin\", huusin, \"unhojuoman -- taivaan Herran mulle suoman --\nenkeleitten mulle tuoman pohjaan tyhjentÃ¤Ã¤ ma saan!\nVihdoin irti muistoistansa kurjan pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ sallitaan!\"\nKorppi huus: \"Ei milloinkaan.\"\n\n\"Turman lintu!

They believe that he may have contracted this virulent and fatal disease from contact with an infected member of the species \"corvus corax,\" or the common raven. Shockingly, scholars and scientists alike have turned to his famous poem \"The Raven\" for a better understanding of the disease\'s effects upon the author. \"It was right there in front of us all along,\" said a spokesperson for the research group, \"it just took some time to puzzle it out.\"\nSince his mysterious death in 1849, scholars have pondered the circumstances that may have led to his demise. The melancholic author seems to have been suffering the final throes of this prolonged disease when he disembarked from a train bound from Richmond, VA to New York late in September 1849 and disappeared for a full week. When discovered, Poe was noted as suffering from feverish delirium, a characteristic symptom of this newly identified flu.\nThe author seems to have been particularly susceptible to the disease because of an atrophying of his limbs resulting from his life-long interest in studying volumes of curious and forgotten lore. Although his reclusive nature served to prevent contact with contagious persons, the author seems to have indulged in conversations with transient birds, a fact that is recorded in \"The Raven\". Indeed, a manuscript dating from the period demonstrates the fever\'s effects on the poet. Also evident in the poem is the fact that Poe\'s immune system had been compromised weeks earlier, due in part to his grief over the passing of his beloved housekeeper, Lenore Neffurmoore. Scholars with the Poe Institute note that his belief in ravens as heralds of the spirit world led to continued contact with members of the species \"corvus corax\" over the next four years, a fact that may have sealed the poet\'s fate.\nAs compelling as this new evidence is, many in the scholarly community remain unconvinced. When questioned about the pitfalls of reading Poe\'s work autobiographically, one researcher (who asked to remain anonymous) retorted, waving a copy of the poem in the air, \"It\'s all here in black and white! Geez, what more do you people need...a smoking gun?!\" No other scholars were available for comment.\nIn light of these findings, literary historians have begun to search for clues of other possible instances of avian flu in contemporary texts in which fowl figure prominently. A prominent symptom is the delirious imagining of the self as bird.  This may lead to a repetitive lapse into imitative noise.  And, although the records of this disease are over a century old, world health officials have been alerted about the potential threat, and are taking the necessary precautions.',NULL),(454,2,'2d9067a76949ffba:bcecc7:1081a597865:-7fcd','2005-12-11 11:04:53',1,'THERE was a momentâ€™s silence. The rain beat against the windows. The lightning played fantastically in the sky.\nâ€œHow I pity such a man,â€ said Poe, almost kindly; â€œto fall below contempt is to fall very low indeed.â€\nâ€œEdgar, dear, do not mind his insults,â€ pleaded Helen, as she hurried to his side tenderly and with the great sympathy of a great womanâ€™s heart. She suffered as deeply as the poet.\nâ€œIt is not that,â€ replied Poe, as in a reverie, for he avoided still her eyes; â€œit is not that which gnaws my heart.â€\nHe seemed to realize for the first time that he had a fair visitor to his little garret, and that something was due from him as host.\nâ€œPardon my discourtesy,â€ he hastened to say. â€œI have grown so thoughtless of late. Did my servant not offer you a chair? Erebus, what do you mean? Bring the ladyâ€”Erebus!â€ Erebus did not respond. â€œPermit me, madam.â€\nPoe felt the need of courtesy, and himself brought a broken chair with all the gallantry of his old-time self. He placed it near her and motioned her to a seat with the beautiful manner of Southern hospitality.\nHelen leaned against the chair but did not take it. She was still not prepared for what she saw--still less for all that she had seen.\n\"Erebus! Erebus!\" called the poet petulantly; but the negro\'s sensibility still kept him from intruding. \"I say, bring the lady some refreshments. She has traveled far. Some wine and cakes, Erebus. We honor ourselves in honoring our fair guest. Erebus, some wine!\" He went to the table and took up a broken dipper. Gradually the realization of his misfortunes came over him. \"I forgot,\" he murmured pathetically. \"Times have changed for me. I am no longer the prodigal son at home.\"\nHe filled a glass with water from the oaken bucket, and with all the pride and the grandeur of a Castilian host approached the lady, who was so very sad and whose eyes were so very full of tears and love and beauty.\n\"Here is one drink left,\" he said softly, but with the bearing of a prince bestowing a blushing goblet on his bride, \"the most priceless gift of them all. Even the tattered vagabond, by lifting a refreshing draught from the wayside stream, in this can play mine host most royally. It comes from the hillside. It is as pure as Mother Earth. Honor me, madam, in God\'s own beverage.\"\nShe took the glass, with seeming gratefulness, lest she might hurt him, and placed it on the table, as though she were not disposed quite yet to drink.\n\"No, no, Edgar,\" she cried. \"Oh, what has happened to you, dearest? Your eyes are so sad and distant. What is it, love? If I am not to be your confidant, then I should not be your wife.\"\nShe took his hand and looked fondly into his eyes. He made no answer.\n\"\'Tis my happiness to divide you cares,\" she still pleaded with womanly tenderness. \"You tremble but do not answer, Edgar. Your silence chills my very heart. Has your love grown cold, and does some other passion now fill your breast?\"\nHe shuddered and looked about him with a delirious glance.\n\"Yes, yes, that is it,\" he whispered in the choked voice of suffering. \"A passion that will devour us both. You have heard it but now the words of your friend--my friend; for God\'s sake, heed his warning, heed his warning.\"\nHe broke from her and tottered to the chair which he had brought for her, and sat upon it, hiding his face in his hands. He shook convulsively. She bent over him tenderly; then kneeled beside him.\n\"You are trifling, Edgar,\" she said passionately. \"Why did you leave me so? You filled me with every hope. You told me, in words such as poets only can speak, how you loved me, and, when I breathed accordant answer to your vows, you were gone; and I had naught but idle words to fill the place of love.\"\nShe still pleaded with him, but he listened for some moments to the storm without before he spoke in answer. His eyes were fixed, distracted.\n\n\"It was a July midnight... \nClad all in white upon a violent bank I saw the... \nAnd thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees \nDidst glide away. Only thine eyes remained. \nThey would not go--they never yet have gone.\"\n\nShe scarcely breathed as he vaguely pronounced these words inscribed \"To Helen.\"\n\"All this,\" she cried in anguish, \"and still you fled from me, Edgar!\"\n\"My promise,\" he answered, unable still to look at her. \"I could not look into your face, it was so like hers. I could not deceive you about myself; and so I fled, fled, fled!\"\nHe rose with a startled movement and went to the table across the room. She followed him, for a terrible look had come into his face. She feared for its meaning.\nThe rain pattered on the roof a melancholy, dreadful reveille like the rattle of many drums.\n\"The ways of Heaven are manifold,\" she pleaded, her arm upon his shoulder; \"God made me in her image for a purpose, Edgar; I believe that purpose was to save you from yourself.\"\n\"Save me!\" he cried in grim humour, his eyes far away. \"For what?--more hours of wretched poverty? I mean--I--I am unworthy of your interest, Helen. I fled from you to save you, not myself. I am past redemption. Oh, why did you follow me here?\"\nThe lightning flashed at the window, and there was a low growl from the distant heavens. He took her hands in his, and for the first time looked deeply into her eyes.\n\"Because I love you, Edgar,\" he replied fervently; \"And Love alone can save you Edgar, as the lesser passion is lost and smothered in the greater. Trust in Love, dear; it has saved the world.\"\nHe shook his head sadly.\n\"I brought wretchedness to one soul who trusted me,\" he exclaimed wildly. \"I cannot to another and live. Look about you. Is this the home to ask a wife to share--a poet\'s garret? Is there no escape from it all? no refuge from self?\"\nHe rushed to the gable window in desperation. In his fancy, the little garret window had suddenly because the great Tarpian rock, whence he could dash his soul to its destruction and perhaps forget his misery. She screamed and followed him--anticipating his thought. She would have been too late, however, had not a flash of lighting filled the window, and for the moment blinded him. She threw her arms about him and clung to him madly.\n\"Edgar,\" she cried, \"for love of Heaven, what would you do?\"\nHe stood in mad uncertainty. A wild, fixed stare came into his eyes.\nFlames leaped from a neighboring building, where the lightning had struck. The engines dashed by, and the ringing of the bells affrighted the people\'s hearts and startled the night.\nPoe answered them with a delirious cry:\n\n\"Hear the loud alarum bells--Brazen bells! \nWhat a tale of terror now their turbulency tells! \nIn the startled ear of night \nHow they scream out their affright! \nToo much horrified to speak, \nThey can only shriek, shriek, Out of tune, \nIn a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire.\"\n\nA moment, and the bells in the distant steeple rang out a merry chime. Poe listened, wavering.\n\"Hush,\" he whispered, \"the bells, bells, bells, bells! They laugh at the storm without and the storm within. Would I were made like them. I would laugh as well.\"\nHelen cried out, with a hopeful heart, at the joyous peal.\n\n\"Hear the mellow wedding bells, \nGolden bells! \nWhat a world of happiness their harmony fortells!\"\n\n\"An omen, Edgar, an omen! They ring out hope for you and hope for me. An omen, love!\"\nShe kissed his hand fervently.\nBells in another steeple rang out in answer; but the chimes were not the same. Now the tolled ghoulishly; and the melancholy that oppressed them was enhanced as the notes were borne on the wings of the storm to the little garret, where life and death and love hung in the balance.\nThe thunder rolled ominously in the distance.\nPoe laughed at the bells mockingly:\n\n\"Hear the tolling of the bells-- \nIron bells; \nWhat a world of solemn thought their melody compels!\"\n\n\"An omen, yes! the wedding march and then the funeral dirge. A merry omen, truly. I would reverse the order to perfect the joy. The tolling first. Aye, my thoughtless valet was right. He arrayed the bridegroom in his funeral clothes, forgetting it was his wedding day.\"\nThere was another distant peal of thunder, echoing the earthly bells. The poet shuddered and crouched near the table, on which the candle flickered low in its socket. It was horror, not fear, that wrought upon him now.\n\"Hark, you hear the roar of the maelstrom! Flee, flee from me, Helen, as you would from Death! It comes, it comes, it comes--for me!\"\nHe seemed like a man distraught. She bent over him anxiously to divert him; but it was hopeless.\n\"Don\'t you hear the ominous flapping of its wings?\" he cried.\n\"\'Tis the storm distracts you, Edgar,\" she answered. \"There is no soul here but you and I.\"\n\"It has no soul. It is a demon,\" cried the poet, in a frenzy of despair; \"the demon of my blighted life. It\'s curse is written--\" his voice was lost in the storm.\nThe poetess turned her head away hopelessly and covered her eyes in prayer, but she did not move from the poet\'s side.\nThe lightning played on the walls through the windows. It came and went, and then it came again.\nThe poet seemed to see in his wild imaginations, as the light danced on the cobwebbed rafters, a raven sitting on a bust of Pallas and fading away with the flashes. Lenore came not; only the Raven, Raven, Raven!\nIt was an awful moment, for death was in the storm.\nHe called upon Helen to witness where the Raven perched upon the bust of Pallas--its basilisk eyes piercing into his very soul; but she could see nothing, for there was nothing.\nShe tried in vain to comfort him, but he would not listen. He did not seem to hear her. A spiritual look came into his face. The lightning played again on the wall.\n\n\"\'Prophet!\' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! \nBy that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore - \nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, \nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore - \nClasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore.\"\n\nThere was a crash of thunder. He would have fallen, but Helen supported him in her arms.\n\"Nevermore! Nevermore! Nevermore!\" he murmured, looking strangely from the light on the wall into Helen\'s eyes.\nThen he shook his head slowly.\n\"Oh, I am a thing, a nameless thing o\'er which the Raven flaps his funeral wing! Lord help my poor soul.\"\nHe sank upon the floor of the garret, which was his last home.\n\"Edgar! Edgar!\" she cried in agony.\nShe sank over him in despair.\nâ€œI understand it now. It is the memory he loved, not me.â€\n\nTony and the doctor came too late.\n\nTHE END',NULL),(455,4,'2d9067a76949ffba:bcecc7:1081a597865:-7fca','2005-12-11 11:21:08',0,'ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTS',NULL),(456,4,'2d9067a76949ffba:bcecc7:1081a597865:-7fcc','2005-12-11 11:13:25',0,'graven4a',NULL),(457,4,'2d9067a76949ffba:bcecc7:1081a597865:-7fcb','2005-12-11 11:14:21',0,'graven5a',NULL),(458,3,'2d9067a76949ffba:bcecc7:1081a597865:-7fc4','2005-12-11 11:24:24',12,'Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n`\'Tis some visitor,\' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -\nOnly this, and nothing more.\'',NULL),(459,3,'2d9067a76949ffba:bcecc7:1081a597865:-7fb7','2005-12-11 11:25:18',347,'Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -\nNameless here for evermore.',NULL),(460,3,'39e706a46ad531be:2c00ebd4:1081ae51dd4:-7fe4','2005-12-11 12:41:02',2771,'CAW!

For me, the defining characteristic of Raskolnikov is his pride, and Sonya, her humility.  The character here seems more in a conundrum if we take \"the Law\" to mean some sort of righteous path.  To enter the gate against the mandate of the gatekeeper would be to hold the Law in contempt.  He could gain entrance, but, as the gatekeeper says, he is powerful.  Powerful here seems more a function of his ability to keep out the man from the country.  Should the man from the country enter, the gatekeeper would cease to have any power.  Of course, so too would the Law have less of an impact on the man.  To enter without permission would destroy the very thing the man seeks, unlike Raskolnikov, who holds the Law in contempt (or thinks he does), and considers that he, a superman, is above the law.\nInstead, I\'m reminded of Thomas More in Bolt\'s \"A Man for All Seasons\":\nWilliam Roper: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law!\nSir Thomas More: Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?\nWilliam Roper: Yes, I\'d cut down every law in England to do that!\nSir Thomas More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned \'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?
